        <p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that specializes in consumer electronics
        ,software and online services.Apple was founded by Steve Jobs,Steve Wosniak and Ronald Wayne on April 
        1,1976.It is a prominent hardware and software company best known its series of computers and iphones
        It has quality based products ,well known for its creativity and smartness.The iphone is a sign of 
        success and popularity.It was named during one of his fruitarian diets.On naming of Apple ,he said
            <p>Apple Inc. had its genesis in the lifelong dream of Stephen G. Wozniak to build his own computer—a dream that was made suddenly feasible with the arrival in 1975 of the first commercially successful microcomputer, the Altair 8800, which came as a kit and used the recently invented microprocessor chip. Encouraged by his friends at the Homebrew Computer Club, a San Francisco Bay area group centred around the Altair, Wozniak quickly came up with a plan for his own microcomputer. In 1976, when the Hewlett-Packard Company, where Wozniak was an engineering intern, expressed no interest in his design, Wozniak, then 26 years old, together with a former high-school classmate, 21-year-old Steve Jobs, moved production operations to the Jobs family garage. Jobs and Wozniak named their company Apple. For working capital, Jobs sold his Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak his programmable calculator. Their first model was simply a working circuit board, but at Jobs’s insistence the 1977 version was a stand-alone machine in a custom-molded plastic case, in contrast to the forbidding steel boxes of other early machines. This Apple II also offered a colour display and other features that made Wozniak’s creation the first microcomputer that appealed to the average person.Though he was a brash business novice whose appearance still bore traces of his hippie past, Jobs understood that in order for the company to grow, it would require professional management and substantial funding. He convinced Regis McKenna, a well-known public relations specialist for the semiconductor industry, to represent the company; he also secured an investment from Michael Markkula, a wealthy veteran of the Intel Corporation who became Apple’s largest shareholder and an influential member of Apple’s board of directors. The company became an instant success, particularly after Wozniak invented a disk controller that allowed the addition of a low-cost floppy disk drive that made information storage and retrieval fast and reliable. With room to store and manipulate data, the Apple II became the computer of choice for legions of amateur programmers. Most notably, in 1979 two Bostonians—Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston—introduced the first personal computer spreadsheet, VisiCalc, creating what would later be known as a “killer app” (application): a software program so useful that it propels hardware sales.

While VisiCalc opened up the small-business and consumer market for the Apple II, another important early market was primary educational institutions. By a combination of aggressive discounts and donations (and an absence of any early competition), Apple established a commanding presence among educational institutions, contributing to its platform’s dominance of primary-school software well into the 1990s.

Competition from IBM
Apple’s profits and size grew at a historic rate: by 1980 the company netted over $100 million and had more than 1,000 employees. Its public offering in December was the biggest since 1956, when the Ford Motor Company had gone public. (Indeed, by the end of 1980, Apple’s valuation of nearly $2 billion was greater than Ford’s.) However, Apple would soon face competition from the computer industry’s leading player, International Business Machines Corporation. IBM had waited for the personal computer market to grow before introducing its own line of personal computers, the IBM PC, in 1981. IBM broke with its tradition of using only proprietary hardware components and software and built a machine from readily available components, including the Intel microprocessor, and used DOS (disk operating system) from the Microsoft Corporation. Because other manufacturers could use the same hardware components that IBM used, as well as license DOS from Microsoft, new software developers could count on a wide IBM PC-compatible market for their software. Soon the new system had its own killer app: the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, which won an instant constituency in the business community—a market that the Apple II had failed to penetrate.</p>

        <FONT SIZE="4">  <p>The iPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a computer, iPod, digital camera and cellular phone 
            into one device with a touchscreen interface. The iPhone runs the iOS operating system, and in 2021 when
             the iPhone 13 was introduced, it offered up to 1 TB of storage and a 12-megapixel camera.
             The original iPhone was announced on Jan. 9, 2007, at the Macworld convention by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.
              While it was not considered the first smartphone, the iPhone has helped drive the global shift to mobile computing
               among both consumers and businesses. Its primary rival has been Google Android-based devices from companies such
                as Samsung, also introduced in 2007.
             The first-generation iPhone came preloaded with a suite of Apple software, including iTunes, the Safari web browser
              and iPhoto. Internet Message Access Protocol and Post Office Protocol 3 email services were integrated with the device.
            
            Apple released the iPhone under an exclusive two-year partnership with AT&T Wireless, but it took less than three months
             for hackers to unlock the device for use on any Global System for Mobile communication network.IPhone 3G, 3GS. Apple 
             released the second-generation iPhone and iPhone operating system (OS) 2.0 on June 9, 2008. The new device was called
              the iPhone 3G, a nod to its new ability to connect to third-generation (3G) cellular networks powered by technologies 
              such as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System and high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA). The iPhone 3G was 
              available in 8 GB and 16 GB models.

             The iPhone OS 2.0 update included several features designed for business, including support for Microsoft Exchange
              email. Improved mobile security features included secure access to corporate networks over Cisco's IPSec virtual 
              private network, plus remote wipe and other management capabilities.
             
             Apple also released in 2008 a software development kit (SDK) for custom applications, a configuration utility for 
             centralized management and, most importantly, its App Store -- a portal through which iPhone users could purchase
              and download additional applications to run on their devices.
             
             The iPhone 3G exchanged the flat aluminum housing of the first-generation iPhone for a sleek, convex black or white
              plastic case. The switch to plastic enabled better transmission for the many radio receivers inside the device.
             
             The iPhone 3G also featured assisted GPS, which combined triangulation using cellular towers with a GPS receiver. 
             It did not support Flash, Java or Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS). Its built-in Bluetooth supported wireless 
             earpieces but not stereo audio, laptop tethering or File Transfer Protocol.
             
             Less than a year after the debut of the iPhone 3G, on June 8, 2009, Apple released the iPhone 3GS and iPhone OS 3.0.
              Available in 16 GB and 32 GB models, the iPhone 3GS featured several hardware improvements, including a video camera, 
              built-in compass and faster download speeds through 7.2 megabits per second (Mbps) HSDPA support.
             
             That new version of the OS brought support for MMS, copy-and-paste functionality and the Find My iPhone app. In addition,
              it offered an expanded SDK that enabled developers to build in-app purchasing features, push notifications and navigation
               capabilities into their third-party apps.Phone 4 and 4S. Apple released the iPhone 4 on June 7, 2010. With this model,
                Apple also changed the name of its OS from iPhone OS to iOS. The name change was made in the aftermath of the April 3, 2010, release of the iPad, which ran the same OS.

               Hardware innovations in the iPhone 4 included Apple's Retina Display, which boasted a higher pixel density than previous iPhone screens and a front-facing camera. For the first time, Apple also produced versions with code division multiple access connectivity, which enabled the device to connect to a wider variety of cellular carriers' networks.
               
               IOS 4 introduced FaceTime, an app that enabled video calling between Apple devices over Wi-Fi. It also brought limited multitasking capabilities to the iPhone, letting users make phone calls or listen to music in one app, while having a different app open on the screen.
               
               On Oct. 4, 2011, Apple released the iPhone 4S, which featured the debut of Siri, a voice-powered digital assistant app. The device ran on Apple's new A5 processors and shipped with iOS 5, which featured the debut of Apple's cloud service, iCloud, and its proprietary text and multimedia messaging technology, iMessage.
               
               IPhone 5, 5c and 5s. The iPhone 5, which was released on Sept. 12, 2012, featured a taller screen than its predecessors, measuring 4 inches diagonally with a 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio and 1136 x 640-pixel resolution. It ran on Apple's A6 processor and included a specially designed nano-SIM card, plus a new connector that was not compatible with plugs and accessories for the iPad, iPod or previous iPhones.
               
               The iPhone 5 was also the first iPhone to support Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks and the 5 gigahertz 802.11ac Wi-Fi band. It was available in 16 GB, 32 GB and 64 GB storage capacity models. The iPhone 5 shipped with iOS 6, whose new features included a native Maps application and Passbook, an app that stores digital credit cards, boarding passes and more.
               
               The iPhone 5s, released on Sept. 20, 2013, shipped with iOS 7 and was powered by a 64-bit dual-core A7 processor. Apple added another new chip called the M7 coprocessor, which handled motion data from the phone's gyroscope, compass and accelerometer.
               
               The iPhone 5 and 5s had the same aluminum frame, chamfered edges, weight and dimensions, weighing just 3.9 ounces and measuring 4.9 x 2.3 x 0.3 inches. The iPhone 5s had an updated camera lens with F2.2 aperture. Other new camera features included slow-motion video and live video zoom capabilities.
               
               Perhaps the biggest change in the iPhone 5s was Touch ID, which turned the phone's Home button into a biometric fingerprint scanner for authenticating access to the device and iTunes.
               
               The iPhone 5c, released on the same day as the 5s, came in five colors: white, pink, yellow, blue and green. It was the same size as the iPhone 5s at 4.9 x 2.3 x 0.3 inches, and it weighed about 4.6 ounces. The iPhone 5c did not run the A7 processor as the iPhone 5s had, however; it ran the A6 processor from the iPhone 5. It also did not share the iPhone 5s' aluminum frame; instead, the iPhone 5c was made of hard-coated polycarbonate with a steel-reinforced interior.
               
               IPhone 6 and 6 Plus; 6s and 6s Plus. Apple released the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus on Sept. 9, 2014. It marked the first time that one iPhone model was available in two different sizes. The iPhone 6 featured a 4.7-inch display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, and the iPhone 6 Plus had a 5.5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 resolution. Both devices ran Apple's A8 processor and M8 motion coprocessor, and they were the first to come with Apple Pay, Apple's mobile payments service.
               
               The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus shipped with iOS 8, which featured a revamped user interface and the new iCloud Drive, Apple's file synchronization service.
               
               On Sept. 25, 2015, Apple released the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus with iOS 9. The new devices ran on Apple's A9 chip and M9 coprocessor. They also included 3D Touch, which enabled users to perform different functions by tapping the screen with various levels of pressure.
               
               IPhone SE first generation. Apple released on March 21, 2016, the iPhone SE, a smaller version of the iPhone 6s. The first iPhone SE featured a 4-inch display but ran on the same A9 and M9 chips as the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. It was available in 16 GB and 64 GB models and came in four colors: space gray, silver, gold and rose gold.
               
               IPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, announced on Sept. 7, 2016, boasted Apple's first water- and dust-resistant casing. The devices, which came in 32 GB, 128 GB and 256 GB versions, also featured two 12-megapixel cameras and Apple's new four-core A10 Fusion processor.
               
               In a major design change, Apple eliminated the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, forcing users to either rely on wireless headphones or an adapter for the iPhone's Lightning port. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus shipped with iOS 10, whose new features included Siri integration with third-party apps and expanded 3D Touch capabilities.
               
               IPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Apple gave the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus a new aluminum and glass design, a six-core A11 Bionic processor and wireless charging capabilities. The devices, released on Sept. 22, 2017, also had new cameras built especially for augmented reality use cases. Both models came in two sizes: 64 GB and 256 GB. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus shipped with iOS 11, which included ARKit, an SDK for augmented reality apps.
               
               IPhone X, XR and XS/XS Max. Apple also announced the iPhone X in September 2017. The iPhone X was the first iPhone to eliminate the physical Home button that was present on every preceding iPhone model, giving the device a touchscreen-only interface. Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, the iPhone X used the A11 Bionic chip.
               
               The iPhone X featured an all-glass design and a 5.8-inch super Retina HD display, making it the largest iPhone in history at the time. The device also marked the debut of Face ID, a new way of authenticating user access through facial recognition technology. The iPhone X came in two storage options -- 64 GB and 256 GB.
               
               In September 2018, Apple announced three more iPhone X models. The iPhone XR was a budget version of the flagship phone that came with a larger 6.1-inch display. But the technology in the display had a lower resolution, Liquid Retina HD display that used LCD as opposed to the light-emitting diode, or OLED, Super Retina HD displays available in iPhone X and XS/XS Max displays. The XR used an upgraded A12 Bionic chip and boasted a battery life that was better than all other X models. The XR could be purchased with either 64 GB or 128 GB storage capacity.
               
               The XS is the successor to the iPhone X model with the upgraded A12 Bionic chip, slightly improved battery life, improved water resistance up to 2 meters for up to 30 minutes and the option to purchase the device with up to 512 GB storage. The XS Max featured the same specs as the XS -- only with a larger 6.5-inch display.
               
               IPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max. Released on Sept. 20, 2019, the iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max are the successors to the iPhone XR, XS and XS Max, respectively. One major advancement of the iPhone 11 series of smartphones is the inclusion of a Wi-Fi 6 wireless chip for improved speeds using the IEEE 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 standard. Another advantage is the infusion of an upgraded 12-megapixel TrueDepth front camera.
               
               The iPhone 11 continued the use of the slightly lower quality 6.1-inch LCD display found in the iPhone XR. However, many iPhone 11 enhancements were made over the XR, including an upgraded A13 Bionic chip, a rear camera with 2x optical zoom and ultra-wide lens, improved battery life, improved water resistance and a 256 GB storage capacity option.
               
               The iPhone 11 Pro also makes significant strides over the iPhone XS. Perhaps the most famous is the three-lens rear-facing camera that Apple put into iPhones for the first time. Other advantages over the XS model include an upgraded A13 Bionic chip, Super Retina XDR display, ultra-wide-angle photo capabilities and up to 4x optical zoom, four additional hours of battery life and improved water resistance up to 4 meters for 30 minutes.
               
               Finally, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is simply an iPhone 11 Pro with a 6.5-inch, as opposed to a 5.8-inch, Super Retina XDR display. Because of the larger size, the iPhone 11 Pro Max uses a larger battery that delivers up to two additional hours of video playback -- 20 total hours for the iPhone Pro Max and 18 hours for the iPhone 11 Pro -- compared to the iPhone 11 Pro.
               
               IPhone SE second generation. Throughout the late 2010s and into 2020, Apple dominated the high-end smartphone market but began losing ground to competitors in the mid- to low-end price range. To counter this, Apple launched a second generation of iPhone SE with upgraded internals on April 15, 2020.
               
               The second-generation SE used a 4.7-inch Retina HD display and A13 Bionic chip, and came in 64 GB, 128 GB or 256 GB storage capacity. The second-generation SE brought back the physical home button with touch ID login capability as opposed to the Face ID authentication features originally introduced in the iPhone X and all newer models up to the SE second gen phone. Thus, not only did this updated SE provide plenty of performance in a lower-cost model -- it also appealed to iPhone users who preferred to have the physical Home button as opposed to the all-touch alternative that all other iPhones evolved toward.
               
               One caveat to note about the iPhone SE is that it shipped without 5G chipset support to connect to wireless carriers that are rolling out 5G commercially. Thus, despite this phone launching just a few months before the iPhone 12, which has 5G support, the iPhone SE is stuck with fourth-generation LTE mobile data capabilities only.
               
               IPhone 12, 12 Pro, 12 Pro Max and 12 mini. The iPhone 12 series of smartphones comes in four different versions. All iPhone 12 models feature the A14 Bionic chip, Super Retina XDR displays, Dolby Vision HDR video recording, water resistance up to 6 meters for 30 minutes and 5G mobile data chipsets.The base iPhone 12 model launched on Oct. 23, 2020, and came with a 6.1-inch display, a 17-hour battery, improved Ceramic Shield casing and 64 GB, 128 GB or 256 GB storage capacity options.

               The iPhone 12 Pro is similar to the base iPhone 12 but with enhanced rear-facing camera hardware and features that produce superior images. The iPhone 12 Pro features a three-lens camera for wide, ultra-wide and telephoto capabilities. Apple also introduced its LiDAR scanner sensor capability in the 12 Pro model. LiDAR scanning technology is used when taking nighttime photos and offers improved autofocus in low light situations. Storage options for the 12 Pro models are 128 GB, 256 GB and 512 GB.
               
               Likely due to larger-size Super Retina XDR display shortages in Apple's manufacturing supply chain, the iPhone 12 Pro Max model launched on Nov. 12, 2020, three weeks after the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro launch. The 12 Pro Max is identical to the 12 Pro with a few notable exceptions. For one, the screen size increased from 6.1 inches on the 12 Pro to 6.7 inches on the 12 Pro Max. Additionally, the 12 Pro Max has a camera lens that can optically zoom up to five times, compared to the 12 Pro's 4x optical zoom. Finally, because of the larger screen size, Apple was able to put a larger battery into the 12 Pro Max, bumping the expected battery life from 17 hours to 20.
               
               The iPhone 12 mini offers the same features as the other iPhone 12 models but in a more compact size -- 5.4 inches vs. the 6.1-inch iPhone 12 Pro or the 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max.
               
               IPhone 13, 13 Mini, 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. The iPhone 13 became available Sept. 24, 2021. As was the case with its predecessor, the iPhone 13 is available in four models: the base iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.
               
               All iPhone 13 models integrate Apple's proprietary A15 Bionic chip -- a six-core CPU. They also integrate a 5G chipset and support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) as well as Bluetooth 5.0. Water resistance on all iPhone 13 models is rated as IP68, meaning a device can potentially last for up to 30 minutes in up to 6 meters of water before it becomes inoperable. All iPhone 13 models are available with 128 GB, 256 GB and 512 GB storage options. The iPhone 13 Pro Max is also available with the largest storage capacity that Apple provides, topping out at 1 TB.
               
               All iPhone models have updated cameras, with new functionality that varies across the models. However, all models include support for a new cinematic mode, which automatically shifts focus as a subject steps into the field of view.
               
               The base iPhone 13 model has a 6.1-inch display, and battery life that provides up to 19 hours of video playback. The iPhone 13 mini has a smaller 5.4-inch display and a shorter battery life of up to 17 hours.
               
               Both the base and mini have a Super Retina XDR display and the same two-camera setup. They both have dual 12MP lenses with wide and ultra-wide capabilities. There is a 2x optical and 5x digital zoom on the dual camera system.
               
               Stepping up from the base and mini are the iPhone 13 pro models with pro features -- once again being focused on camera hardware boosts. The iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch display while the iPhone Pro Max is about 10% bigger at 6.7 inches. The display used for both pro models is the Super Retina XDR with ProMotion, providing faster screen refresh rates than the base models.
               
               The iPhone Pro differentiator is the use of a three-camera system -- providing telephoto, wide and ultra-wide capabilities. The pro camera system also has a larger optical zoom range than the base models -- coming in at 6x -- and a digital zoom of 15x. As was the case with the iPhone 12 series, the iPhone 13 Pro cameras also benefit from a LiDAR scanner for better low-light and night photography.</p></FONT>

            <FONT SIZE="4"></FONT> <P>The iPad is a brand of iOS and iPadOS-based tablet computers developed by Apple Inc. It is the successor of the Newton MessagePad and an unreleased prototype of the PowerBook Duo-based tablet computer. Apple concepted the iPad before the related iPhone, although the latter was developed and released first. Speculations of the original iPad began in 2002, and dealt with its development, operating system, and release, prior to its introduction on January 20, 2010. It consists of four lineups, the original iPad lineup and three flagships, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro.

            It initially used the iPhone's iOS operating system but was later replaced with an optimized derivation of iOS, iPadOS.Apple's first tablet computer and the iPad's predecessor was the Newton MessagePad, which was introduced in 1993. Apple also designed an alternative prototype of the PowerBook Duo-based tablet computer but decided not to sell it to avoid hurting MessagePad sales.[3][4] The Newton MessagePad was created under the leadership of John Sculley, who succeeded Apple co-founder Steve Jobs after he was forced out of Apple in 1985. The MessagePad was a technological failure, and its handwriting recognition often resulted in an indecipherable jumble of words. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he discontinued the MessagePad.[5]

            The development of an iPad tablet computer was first speculated in 2002 when Apple's associated manufacturing company Quanta leaked orders from Apple on wireless displays. Less than two weeks later after US Design Patent No. D504,889 leaked a concept design of the iPad in May 2005, the blogger Rob Bushway speculated that it would use a stripped-down version of OS X. Speculation then turned to Intel, who was visited by Apple to sought a chip to use on one of their potential products, speculatively the iPad. In September 2009, the Taiwan Economic News said that the iPad would be announced sometimes in February 2010 and cited "industry sources," but it was in fact, announced in January 2010.[6]
            
            The iPad's conception predated that of the iPhone, although the iPhone was chronologically developed and released before the iPad.[7][8] In 1991, Apple chief design officer Jonathan Ive devised an industrial design of a stylus-based tablet, the Macintosh Folio, which laid the foundation for a larger tablet prototype project codenamed K48 (the iPad) that Apple began in 2004. After seeking to develop the tablet first, Ive come to an agreement with Jobs that the iPhone was more important and reversed the order.[9][10][11]
            
            iPad
            The first generation of iPad was announced on January 20, 2010,[12] with pre-order began on March 12.[13] The Wi-Fi version was released in the United States on April 3, while the Wi-Fi- 3G version was released on April 30 [14] Apple released the first generation of iPad internationally on May 28, July 23, and September 17. It used an single-GHz Apple A4 chip, with 256 MB of RAM, and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. Its four switches included a home button (which directs the user to its homepage), and the wake/sleep and volume/down switches. Its multitouch-based display had a resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels.[15]
            
            The second generation of iPad was announced on March 2, 2011 and released on March 11. It is 33% thinner and 15% lighter than its predecessor, and it used a dual-core Apple A5 chip, which comprised a 2x faster CPU and a 9x faster GPU. It added several front-and-back cameras that support Apple's FaceTime video-telephony service. Apple reduced the size of the iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from its display and integrated a thinner glass technology for the screen overlay. In addition to a slight contract of space between the display and battery.[16][17][18]

Its Retina Display had a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536 pixels, 50% more pixel densities than standard displays. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic "native" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.[20][21The fourth generation of iPad was announced on October 23, 2012 and released on November 2. It had an A6X chip, an added 1020P FaceTime HD camera, improved LTE and WiFi connectivity, and it added supports for Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition biometric authentication. It featured a 5-megapixel, rear-facing camera capable of recording 1080p-quality videos; and a 720p HD front-facing FaceTime HD camera.

            The eighth generation of iPad was announced on September 15, 2020 and released on September 18. It used an Apple A12 Bionic chip, which comprised a 40% faster 6-core CPU and a 2x faster 4-core CPU than its predecessor. The Apple A12 also included an embedded Neural Engine, and is capable of processing 5 trillion operations per second. Its Retina Display had a resolution of 1668 by 2388 pixels.[29][30]
            
            The ninth generation of iPad was announced and released on September 14, 2021. It used an Apple A13 Bionic chip, which comprised a 20% faster CPU, GPU, and an embedded, artificial intelligence-immersed Neural Engine.[31] Its 12-megapixel front camera add support for Apple's "Center Stage Mode" technology, which pinpoints the positions of the users and automatically tracks the camera view accordingly to perspectivally centralize them. Its Retina Display featured True Tone technology, which automatically adjust the screen color temperature accordingly to the ambident lightning rates.[32][33]
            
            iPad Mini
            The first generation of the flagship, smaller iPad Mini was announced on October 23, 2012 and released on November 2.

Its front 7-megapixel Facetime Camera is of 1080p and 60 fps, while its 12-megapixel webcam featured 8 aperture, 4k, 60fps, and video stabilization. Apple re-integrated Touch ID and replaced Face ID due to the Face ID's inaccurate recognition to mask-wearing users in the Covid-19 pandemic.[41][42]
            
            iPad Pro
            The first generation of iPad Pro, a high-end and professional flagship, was announced on September 9, 2015 and released on November 11, (12.9-inch version) and March 31 (9.7-inch).It used an Apple A9X chip, with a 2x higher memory bandwidth and a 1.8x faster CPU than its predecessor.

It also had a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera and a 7-megapixel front-facing camera.[45]
            
            The third generation of iPad Pro was announced on October 30, 2018 and released on November 7, and it is the first iPad to support 1 TB of storage. It used a 7nm Apple A12X Bionic chip, which comprised 11 billion transistors, an 8-core GPU CPU, a 7-core GPU with 4 efficient core, and an embedded Neural Engine capable of processing 5 trillion operations per second. Apple replaced the Touch ID fingerprint recognition biometric authentication with its facial counterpart, Face ID.[46]
            
            The fourth generation of iPad Pro was announced and released on March 18, 2020. It used an Apple A12Z chip, with an 8-core CPU and a thermal architecture. Its Gibt-class Wi-Fi connectivity is 60% faster than that of its predecessor. Its ultra-wide camera doubled its clarity, while its 12-megapixel camera is capable of capturing 4k quality recording. These cameras allow it to capture medias with wider visibility, and its audio system automatically detects and attracts any orientation nearby.[47]
            
            The fifth generation of iPad Pro was April 20, 2021 and released on May 21. It used an innovative desktop-class Apple M1 chip, which comprised a 40% faster 8-core CPU, a 4x faster 8-core GPU, and a 4x higher bandwidth. It featured a ƒ/1.8 aperture 12-megapixel wide-angle pro camera (captures high quality shots) and a ƒ/2.4 aperture 2-megapixel ultrawide camera (captures enhanced Augmented Reality interactive experience). It debuted Apple's "Center Stage mode" technology, which pinpoints the positions of the users and automatically tracks the camera view accordingly to perspectivally centralize them. The 12.0-inch version had a mini LED-based Liquid Retina XDR display, compared to the 11-inch model's lesser IPS LCD-based Liquid Retina display.[48][49]
            
            Operating system support 
            Cellular connectivity
            iPad models come in two basic variants: Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi with cellular support. The cellular variants however do not support circuit-switched voice calls and texts, only data connectivity. The side of the Wi-Fi + 3G iPad had a micro-SIM slot (not mini-SIM). The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible GSM carrier, unlike the iPhone, which is usually sold 'locked' to specific carriers.[50] On the first generations of the iPad in the U.S., data network access via T-Mobile's network was limited to slower EDGE cellular speeds because T-Mobile's 3G Network at the time used different frequencies.[51][52]
            
            The second generation iPad introduced a third tier of models with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&T capable version.[53]
            
            The iPad up to the 4th generation uses a Micro-SIM, while the first-generation iPad Mini uses a nano-SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5. The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide. Both devices support the same quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT&T network), while the other adds support for LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B.[citation needed]
            
            The 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, pentaband UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant that supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).[citation needed]
            
            Accessories
            Main article: iPad accessories
            Apple offers several iPad accessories,[54] most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.[55] A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad,[56] but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.[citation needed]
            
            Apple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector, one to USB Type A, the other an SD card reader. Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB audio card or MIDI keyboard.[57] A third party sells an adapter that includes USB, SD, and MicroSD on a single unit.[58] An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector.[59] While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.[60]
            
            Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2, 3, or 4. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.[61] While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.[62] In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case – a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.[63]
            
            Software
            Main articles: iPadOS, iOS, and iOS version history
            Like the iPhone, with which it shares a development environment[64] the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices.[65][failed verification] The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen.[66] Developers may also create or modify apps to take advantage of the iPad's features,[67] and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016.[68] Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad.[69] The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010;[70] to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.[71]
            
            Interface
            The interface is centred on the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.[72][failed verification]
            
            Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.[citation needed]
            
            Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch. The iPad's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as "pinching".[citation needed]
            
            Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.[citation needed]
            
            Other user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a "back" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.[citation needed]
            
            Multimedia
            The layout of the music library is similar to an iPod or current[when?] Symbian S60 phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.[citation needed]
            
            Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow, likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.[citation needed]
            
            The iPad supports gapless playback.[73] Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPad can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.[citation needed]
            
            The iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.[citation needed]
            
            Internet connectivity
            The iPad can use Wi-Fi network trilateration from Skyhook Wireless to provide location information to applications such as Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.[74] The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no Ethernet or USB port.[55] However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.[citation needed]
            
            Applications
            The iPad comes with several applications, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, iPod, iTunes, App Store, Apple Books, Maps, Notes, Calendar, and Contacts.[75] Several are improved versions of applications developed for the iPhone or Mac. The apps currently missing are the weather, calculator, and health apps.[76]
            
            The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC.[77] Apple ported its iWork suite from the Mac to the iPad, and sells pared down versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps in the App Store.[78] Although the iPad is not designed to replace a mobile phone, a user can use a wired headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place telephone calls over Wi-Fi or 3G using a VoIP application.[79] As of June 2012, there were about 225,000 iPad specific apps on the App Store.[80][needs update]
            
            In December 2010, Reuters reported that iPhone and iPad users have lodged a lawsuit against Apple alleging that some applications were passing their information to third party advertisers without consent.[81]]</P></font>

                <FONT SIZE="4">  <P>The MacBook is a brand of Macintosh notebook computers designed and marketed by Apple Inc. that use Apple's macOS operating system since 2006. It replaced the PowerBook and iBook brands during the Mac transition to Intel processors, announced in 2005. The current lineup consists of the MacBook Air (2008–present) and the MacBook Pro (2006–present). Two different lines simply named "MacBook" existed from 2006 to 2012 and 2015 to 2019.

                    On November 10, 2020, Apple announced models of the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro incorporating the new Apple M1 system on a chip.[1]
                    
                    Now the latest generation of Apple's chip is the M1 Pro and M1 Max only available on the MacBooks Pro (14" and 16")The MacBook family was initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines which preceded them, now making use of a unibody aluminum construction first introduced with the MacBook Air. This new construction also has a black plastic keyboard that was first used on the MacBook Air, which itself was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate MacBooks. The now standardized keyboard brings congruity to the MacBook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body.

                    The lids of the MacBook family are held closed by a magnet with no mechanical latch, a design element first introduced with the polycarbonate MacBook. Memory, drives, and batteries were accessible in the old MacBook lineup, though the newest compact lineup solders or glues all such components in place. All of the current MacBooks feature backlit keyboards.
                    
                    The MacBook was discontinued from February 2012 until March 2015, when a new model featuring an ultraportable design and an all-metal enclosure was introduced. It was again discontinued in July 2019 following a price reduction of the 3rd generation MacBook Air and discontinuation of the 2nd generation model.
                    
                    MacBook family models

                    Current
                    MacBook Air
                    The MacBook Air is Apple's least expensive notebook computer. While the 1st generation was released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the 2006 - 2012 MacBook, lowered prices on subsequent iterations and the discontinuation of that MacBook has made it serve as the entry-level Macintosh portable. The 2010 to 2017 base model came with a 13-inch screen and was Apple's thinnest notebook computer until the introduction of the MacBook in March 2015. This MacBook Air model features two USB Type-A 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 2 port, as well as an SDXC card slot (only on the 13inch model). This model of MacBook Air did not have a Retina Display. A MacBook Air model with an 11-inch screen was available from October 2010 to October 2016. In 2017, the MacBook Air received a small refresh, with the processor speed increased to 1.8 GHz.
                    
                    On October 30, 2018, the MacBook Air underwent a major design change, dropping the USB Type-A ports, MagSafe, and the SD card slot in favor of two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. It was updated with a Retina display and Intel Y-series Amber Lake i5 CPUs, as well as a Force Touch trackpad, a third-generation butterfly mechanism keyboard, and the Touch ID sensor found in the fourth-generation MacBook Pro, but without the Touch Bar. The base price was also raised, although the base configuration of the 2017 model was retained until July 9, 2019, when it was discontinued along with the Retina MacBook.[2] The base price of this model was also dropped to $1099 ($999 for students) on the same day.[3]
                    
                    On November 10, 2020, Apple announced that the MacBook Air would use the new Apple M1 system on a chip. The new Air does not have a fan, ensuring silent operation, but limiting the M1 chip speed in sustained operations. Performance was claimed to be higher than most current Intel laptops.[1]
                    
                    MacBook Pro
                    The MacBook Pro is Apple's higher-end notebook available in both 13-inch and 16-inch configurations. The current generation 13-inch MacBook Pro was introduced in October 2018. It features a touch-sensitive OLED display strip located in place of the function keys, a Touch ID sensor integrated with the power button, and four USB-C ports that also serve as Thunderbolt 3 ports. The 13-inch model was also available in a less expensive configuration with conventional function keys and only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, but since July 2019, the base MacBook Pro model has the Touch Bar as well as quad-core processors, similar to the higher-end models, although it still has only two USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports.[4] The May 4, 2020 refresh adopts many of the upgrades seen in the 16" 2019 MacBook Pro, including the scissor mechanism keyboard ("Magic Keyboard") and a physical Escape button.
                    
                    On November 13, 2019, Apple released the 16-inch MacBook Pro, replacing the 15-inch model of the previous generation, and replacing the butterfly keyboard with a scissor mechanism keyboard (dubbed the Magic Keyboard by Apple), reverting to the old "inverted-T" arrow key layout, replacing the virtual Escape key on the Touch Bar with a physical key, and replacing the AMD Polaris and Vega graphics from the 15-inch model with options from AMD's Navi graphics architecture, as well as reengineering the speakers, microphone array, and the thermal system compared to the 15-inch; the latter had thermal limitations in the 15-inch model due to its design. In addition, the 16-inch is available with up to 64 GB of DDR4 2667 MHz RAM and up to 8 TB of SSD storage. It also has a 100 Wh battery; this is the largest battery that can be easily carried onto a commercial airliner under U.S. Transportation Security Administration rules.[5][6][7]
                    
                    On November 10, 2020, Apple announced a new model of the MacBook Pro incorporating the new Apple M1 system on a chip. Apple will continue to sell versions of the MacBook Pro with Intel processors. The MacBook Pro with M1 SoC incorporates a fan, allowing sustained operation of the M1 chip at its full performance level, which is claimed to match or exceed that of Intel versions. Unlike Intel Pro models, the M1 version only comes with a 13-inch screen, has only two Thunderbolt ports and has a maximum of 16 GB random access memory (RAM).[1]
                    
                    On October 18, 2021, Apple announced updated 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models during an online event.[8] They are based on the M1 Pro and M1 Max, Apple's first professional-focused ARM-based systems on a chip. This release addressed many criticisms of the previous generation[9] by reintroducing hard function keys in place of the Touch Bar, an HDMI 2.0 port,[10] a SDXC reader and MagSafe charging. Other additions include a Liquid Retina XDR display with thinner bezels and an iPhone-like notch, ProMotion supporting 120Hz variable refresh rate, a 1080p webcam, Wi-Fi 6, 3 Thunderbolt 4 ports, a six-speaker sound system supporting Dolby Atmos, and support for a third 6K display on M1 Max models.[11] The 16-inch version is bundled with a 140W GaN power supply that supports USB-C Power Delivery 3.1, though only MagSafe supports full-speed charging as the machine's USB-C ports are limited to 100W.[12]
                    
                    === Discontinued === It was discontinued on July 20, 2011, for consumer purchase and in February 2012 for institutions, being superseded by the 2nd generation MacBook Air, as the 11-inch model introduced in 2010 had the same starting price of the MacBook.[13] The sales of the Mac computers amounted to 18.21 million units in Apple’s 2018 fiscal year.[14]
                    
                    The Retina MacBook was a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in March 2015. It was discontinued on July 9, 2019, as it had been superseded by the 13-inch Retina MacBook Air, which had a lower base price ($1,299 for the MacBook, $1,199 for the 2018 MacBook Air, and $1,099 for the 2019 MacBook Air), additional USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports (the MacBook has only one USB-C port vs two USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports on the MacBook Air), and better performance.[15]
                    
                    All Intel-based MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models were discontinued in November 2020 and October 2021 respectively, and replaced by Apple silicon models.</P></FONT>

                    <FONT SIZE="4"></FONT> <P>iMac is a family of all-in-one Macintosh desktop computers designed and built by Apple Inc. It has been the primary part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its debut in August 1998, and has evolved through seven distinct forms.[1]

                    In its original form, the iMac G3 had a gumdrop or egg-shaped look, with a CRT monitor, mainly enclosed by a colored, translucent plastic case, which was refreshed early on with a sleeker design notable for its slot-loaded optical drive. The second major revision, the iMac G4, moved the design to a hemispherical base containing all the main components and an LCD monitor on a freely moving arm attached to it. The third and fourth major revisions, the iMac G5 and the Intel iMac respectively, placed all the components immediately behind the display, creating a slim unified design that tilts only up and down on a simple metal base.
                    
                    The fifth major revision (mid 2007) shared the same form as the previous model, but was thinner and used anodized aluminum and a glass panel over the entire front. The sixth major revision (late 2012) uses a different display unit, omits the SuperDrive, and uses different production techniques from the older unibody versions. This allows it to be thinner at the edge than older models, with an edge thickness of 5.9 mm (but the same maximum depth). It also includes a dual microphone setup and includes solid-state drive (SSD) or hard disk storage, or an Apple Fusion Drive, a hybrid of solid-state and hard disk drives. This version of the iMac was announced in October 2012, with the 21.5-inch (55 cm) version released in November and the 27-inch (69 cm) version in December; these were refreshed in September 2013, with new Haswell processors, faster graphics, faster and larger SSD options and 802.11ac Wi-Fi cards.[2]
                    
                    In October 2014, the seventh major revision of the 27-inch (69 cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a "Retina 5K" display at a resolution of 5120 × 2880 pixels. The new model also includes a new processor, graphics chip, and IO, along with several new storage options.[3] The seventh major revision of the 21.5-inch (55 cm) iMac was announced in October 2015. Its main feature is a "Retina 4K" display at a resolution of 4096 × 2304 pixels. It has the same new processor, graphics chip, and I/O as the 27-inch iMac, along with several new storage options.[4]
                    
                    On June 5, 2017, Apple announced a workstation-class version called the iMac Pro, which features Intel Xeon processors and standard SSD storage. It shares the design and screen of the 5K iMac, but is colored in Space Gray rather than silver. Apple began shipping the iMac Pro in December 2017.[5] The iMac Pro was discontinued in 2021.[6]
                    
                    On April 20, 2021, Apple announced a 24" iMac (actual diagonal screen size is 23.5 in.[7]) with an Apple M1 processor, its first as part of its transition to Apple silicon.[8] It comes in 7 colors (Silver, Blue, Green, Orange, Yellow, Purple, and Pink) with a 4.5K Retina display. On the base configuration, the M1 iMacs come with two Thunderbolt 3/USB 4 ports, and two USB Type-C 3.1 Gen 2 ports on the higher configurations. The base configuration models are only available in Silver, Blue, Green, and Pink. Apple claims that the M1 iMac offers up to 85% faster CPU performance than the previous 21.5” iMac models. This iMac is the thinnest being only 11.5mm thin due to the entire logic board and speakers being housed in the bottom “chin” of the iMac.The announcement of iMac in 1998 was a source of controversy and anticipation among commentators, Mac fans, and detractors. Opinions were divided over Apple's drastic changes to the Macintosh hardware. At the time, Apple had suffered a series of setbacks as consumers increasingly opted for Wintel (Windows PCs with Intel CPUs) machines instead of Apple's Performa models. Many in the industry thought that "beleaguered" Apple would soon be forced to start selling computers with a custom interface built on top of one or more potential operating system bases, such as Taligent, Solaris, or Windows 98.[9]

                    The designer behind iMac's case was Jonathan Ive.[10]
                    
                    Ken Segall was an employee at an L.A. ad agency handling Apple's account who came up with the name "iMac" and pitched it to Steve Jobs. After Jobs' death, Segall claimed Jobs preferred "MacMan" for the name of the computer, but after Segall pitched "iMac" to him twice, the name was accepted.[11] Segall says that the "i" stands for "Internet",[12] but also represents the product as a personal and revolutionary device ('i' for "individuality" and "innovation").[13] Apple later adopted the 'i' prefix across its consumer hardware and software lines, such as iPod, iBook (later MacBook), iPhone, iPad and various pieces of software such as the iLife, iCloud, suite and iWork and the company's media player/store, iTunes.
                    
                    Attention was given to the out-of-box experience: the user needed to go through only two steps to set up and connect to the Internet. "There's no step 3!" was the catch-phrase in a popular iMac commercial narrated by actor Jeff Goldblum.[14] Another commercial, dubbed "Simplicity Shootout", pitted seven-year-old Johann Thomas and his border collie Brodie, with an iMac, against Adam Taggart, a Stanford University MBA student, with an HP Pavilion 8250, in a race to set up their computers. Johann and Brodie finished in 8 minutes and 15 seconds,[15] whereas Adam was still working on it by the end of the commercial.
                    
                    Updates
                    By 2005, it had become more and more apparent that IBM's development for the desktop implementation of PowerPC was grinding to a halt. Apple announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference that it would be switching the Macintosh to the x86 architecture and Intel's line of Core processors. The first Intel-equipped Macs were unveiled on January 10, 2006: the Intel iMac and the introductory MacBook Pro. Within nine months, Apple had smoothly transitioned the entire Macintosh line to Intel. One of the highly touted side benefits of this switch was the ability to run Windows on Mac hardware.On July 27, 2010, Apple updated its line of iMacs to feature the new Intel Core "i-series" processors across the line. The 21.5" models now feature the Core i3 processor, but these are upgradable to the Core i5. The high end 27" features a Quad-Core i5 processor, which is upgradable to a Quad-Core i7. On this date Apple also announced its new "Apple Magic Trackpad" peripheral, a trackpad similar to that of MacBook Pro for use with iMac or any other Apple computer. Apple also introduced a AA NiMH battery charger intended to simplify the use of batteries in these peripherals. Apple offers an option to use a solid state drive instead of a large mechanical drive.

                    On May 3, 2011, Apple updated its iMac line with the introduction of Intel Thunderbolt technology and Intel Core i5 and i7 Sandy Bridge processors as well as a 1 mega pixel high definition FaceTime camera, features which were first introduced in the MacBook Pro line in February 2011.[16]
                    
                    On October 23, 2012, a new iMac was announced (for a November/December release) with a substantially thinner edge, new Apple Fusion Drive, faster processors (Intel Core i5 and i7 Ivy Bridge) and graphics along with updates to the ports, but with the same overall depth (stand depth: 8 inches (20.3 cm)). To reduce the edge, the SuperDrive was removed on these iMacs.
                    
                    On October 16, 2014, a new version of the 27-inch (69 cm) iMac was announced, whose main feature is a "Retina 5K" display at a resolution of 5120 × 2880 pixels.[17] The new model also includes a new processor, graphics chip, and I/O, along with several new storage options. This computer was designed with professional photographers and video editors in mind, with the 5K resolution allowing 4K video to be played at its native resolution in Final Cut Pro, with room for toolbars on the side.
                    
                    On June 6, 2017, Apple’s 21.5-inch iMac, which has a "Retina 4K" display at a resolution of 4096 × 2304 pixels, and the latest Intel 7th generation i5 processor, was announced. The iMac has Turbo Boost up to 3.6 GHz supported, and 1 TB hard drive. Apple’s iMac with 4K display has Intel Core i5 quad-core processor with 3 GHz or 3.4 GHz clock speed. The RAM on board is 8 GB, and it will support Turbo boost of up to 3.8 GHz. This iMac has options of 1 TB hard drive or 1 TB Fusion Drive. This 21.5-inch iMac also has the option of Radeon Pro 555 with 2 GB of video RAM for graphics or a Radeon Pro 560 with 4 GB of video RAM. Apple’s 27-inch iMac with the 5K display comes with the quad-core Intel Core i5 processor, which is clocked at 3.4 GHz, 3.5 GHz, or 3.8 GHz. This iMac supports Turbo boost of up to 4.2Ghz and comes with 8 GB RAM option.[18]
                    
                    In March 2019, Apple updated the iMac to feature 9th-generation Intel Core i9 processors and Radeon Vega graphics. Unlike most other Apple releases, Apple opted not to announce the iMac at an event, rather to update the specs and release a press statement. For the first time, the iMac can support 6-core or 8-core Intel processors. Apple claims the 21.5-inch model is up to 60% faster than the previous model, and the 27-inch is up to 2.4 times faster. The exterior of the machine remained the same as the previous model.
                    
                    On August 4, 2020, Apple refreshed the iMac models. The smaller 21.5-inch model was updated with SSDs standard. The 27-inch model received 10th generation Intel chips, a T2 Security chip, a 1080p camera, studio-quality microphone, an option for nano-textured glass, as well as SSDs standard. The 27 inch model now has SSDs soldered to the motherboard, which means the storage is no longer replaceable, and in order to replace a hard drive the entire motherboard must be replaced and any data on the drive will be wiped.[19]
                    
                    On April 20, 2021, Apple announced redesigned iMacs with a 24-inch display, new colors (7), updated cameras, and the inclusion of the Apple M1 chip.
                    
                    Influence
                    The original iMac was the first legacy-free PC.[20] It was the first Macintosh computer to have a USB port but no floppy disk drive. Subsequently, all Macs have included USB. Via the USB port, hardware makers could make products compatible with both x86 PCs and Macs. Previously, Macintosh users had to seek out certain hardware, such as keyboards and mice specifically tailored for the "old world" Mac's unique ADB interface and printers and modems with MiniDIN-8 serial ports. Only a limited number of models from certain manufacturers were made with these interfaces, and often came at a premium price. USB, being cross-platform, has allowed Macintosh users to select from a large selection of devices marketed for the Wintel PC platform, such as hubs, scanners, storage devices, USB flash drives, and mice. After the iMac, Apple continued to remove older peripheral interfaces and floppy drives from the rest of its product line.
                    
                    Borrowing from the 1997 Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh, the various LCD-based iMac designs continued the all-in-one concept first envisioned in Apple's original Macintosh computer. The successful iMac allowed Apple to continue targeting the Power Macintosh line at the high-end of the market. This foreshadowed a similar strategy in the notebook market when the iMac-like iBook was released in 1999. Since then, the company has continued this strategy of differentiating the consumer versus professional product lines. Apple's focus on design has allowed each of its subsequent products to create a distinctive identity. Apple avoided using the beige colors then pervading the PC industry. The company would later drift from the multicolored designs of the late 1990s and early 2000s. The latter part of the decade saw Apple using anodized aluminum; glass; and white, black, and clear polycarbonate plastics among their build materials. Today many PCs are more design-conscious than before the iMac's introduction, with multi-shaded design schemes being common, and some desktops and laptops available in colorful, decorative patterns.[21]
                    
                    Apple's use of translucent, candy-colored plastics inspired similar industrial designs in other consumer products.[22] Apple's later introduction of the iPod, iBook G3 (Dual USB), and iMac G4 (all featuring snowy-white plastic), inspired similar designs in other companies' consumer electronics products. The color rollout also featured two distinctive ads: one called 'Life Savers' featured the Rolling Stones song, "She's a Rainbow" and an advertisement for the white version had the introduction of Cream's "White Room" as its backing track[citation needed].
                    
                    Reception
                    iMac has received considerable critical acclaim, including praise from technology columnist Walt Mossberg as the "Gold Standard of desktop computing";[23] Forbes magazine described the original candy-colored line of iMac computers as being an "industry-altering success".[24] The first 24" Core 2 Duo iMac received CNET's "Must-have desktop" in their 2006 Top 10 Holiday Gift Picks.[25]
                    
                    Apple faced a class-action lawsuit filed in 2008 for allegedly deceiving the public by promising millions of colors from the LCD screens of all Mac models while its 20-inch model only held 262,144 colors.[26] This issue arose due to the use of 6-bit per pixel Twisted nematic LCD screens. The case was dismissed on January 21, 2009.[27]
                    
                    While not a criticism of iMac per se, the integrated design has some inherent tradeoffs that have garnered criticism. In The Mythical Midrange Mac Minitower, Dan Frakes of Macworld suggests that with iMac occupying the midrange of Apple's product line, Apple has little to offer consumers who want some ability to expand or upgrade their computers, but do not need (or cannot afford) the Mac Pro.[28] For example, iMac's integration of monitor and computer, while convenient, commits the owner to replace both at the same time. For a time before the Mac mini's introduction, there were rumors of a "headless iMac"[29] but the G4 Mac mini as introduced had lower performance compared to the iMac, which at the time featured a G5 processor.[30] Some third party suppliers such as Other World Computing provide upgrade kits that include specialized tools for working on iMacs.
                    
                    Similarly, though the graphics chipset in some Intel models is on a removable MXM, neither Apple nor third parties have offered retail iMac GPU upgrades, with the exception of those for the original iMac G3's "mezzanine" PCI slot. Models after iMac G5 (excluding the August 7, 2007 iMac update) made it difficult for the end-user to replace the hard disk or optical drive, and Apple's warranty explicitly forbids upgrading the socketed CPU. While conceding the possibility of a mini-tower cannibalizing sales from the Mac Pro, Frakes argues there is enough frustration with iMac's limitations to make such a proposition worthwhile. This disparity has become more pronounced after the G4 era since the bottom-end Power Mac G5 (with one brief exception) and Mac Pro models have all been priced in the US$1999–2499 range, while base model Power Macs G4s and earlier were US$1299–1799. The current generation iMac has Intel 5th generation i5 and i7 processors, ranging from quad-core 2.7 GHz i5 to a quad-core 3.4 GHz i7 processor,[31] however it is possible to upgrade the 2010 edition of the iMac quite easily.[32]</P></FONT>

                    <FONT SIZE="4"></FONT> <P>AirPods are wireless Bluetooth earbuds designed by Apple Inc. They were first announced on September 7, 2016 alongside the iPhone 7. Within two years, they became Apple's most popular accessory.[3][4] They are Apple's entry-level wireless headphones, sold alongside the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max.

                        In addition to playing audio, the AirPods contain a microphone that filters out background noise as well as built-in accelerometers and optical sensors capable of detecting taps and pinches (e.g. double-tap or pinch to pause audio) and placement within the ear, which enables automatic pausing of audio when they are taken out.[5]
                        
                        On March 20, 2019, Apple released the second-generation AirPods, which feature the H1 chip, longer talk time, and hands-free "Hey Siri" support. An optional wireless charging case which costs extra was added in the offerings.
                        
                        On October 26, 2021, Apple released the third-generation AirPods, which feature an external redesign with shorter stems similar to AirPods Pro, spatial audio, IPX4 water resistance, longer battery life, and MagSafe charging capability.1st generation
                        Apple announced the first generation AirPods on September 7, 2016 at an Apple Special Event alongside the iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Series 2. Apple originally planned to release the AirPods in late October,[6] but delayed the release date.[7] On December 13, 2016, Apple began taking online orders for AirPods. They were available at Apple Stores, Apple Authorized Resellers, and select carriers on December 20, 2016.[8][9]
                        
                        AirPods contain a proprietary Apple W1 SoC processor which helps optimize battery use as well as the Bluetooth 4.2 and audio connections. The advanced connectivity functions of the W1 requires devices running iOS 10, macOS Sierra, watchOS 3, or later.[1] They can also function as standard Bluetooth headphones when connected to any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, including Windows laptops and Android devices.[10][11][12][13]
                        
                        There are two microphones inside each AirPod, one facing outward at ear level and another at the bottom of the stem.[14][15] Each AirPod weighs 0.14 oz (4.0 g), and its charging case weighs 1.34 oz (38 g). The AirPods are capable of holding a charge of around five hours. Charging them for fifteen minutes in the case gives three hours of listening time.[15] The charging case provides 24 hours of total usage time.[16] During a complete dismantling, each AirPod was found to contain a 93 milliwatt hour battery in its stem, while the charging case contains a 1.52 watt hour or 398 mAh at 3.81 V battery.[17]
                        
                        The model numbers for the first-generation AirPods are A1523 and A1722.[18]
                        
                        Production of the first-generation AirPods was discontinued on March 20, 2019, after the second generation was released.[19]
                        
                        2nd generation
                        Apple announced the second generation AirPods on March 20, 2019.[20][21] They are the same design as the first generation, but have updated features.[21] They include an H1 processor which supports hands-free "Hey Siri", Bluetooth 5 connectivity. Apple also claims 50% more talk time and faster device connection times.[21] The "Announce Messages with Siri” feature was added in iOS 13.2, which allows the user to dictate text messages to Siri.[22]
                        
                        Second-generation AirPods can be purchased with the same charging case as the first generation, or for an additional price bundled with the Wireless Charging Case, which can be used with Qi chargers. The Wireless Charging Case can be purchased separately and is compatible with first-generation AirPods. It moves the charging indicator LED to the exterior of the case.[23] The Wireless Charging Case was initially announced in September 2017 alongside the AirPower charging mat, but was delayed by AirPower's protracted development and eventual cancellation.[24] The second generation AirPods remained on sale with a price cut following the release of the third generation in October 2021, but are now only available with the lightning charging case.
                        
                        The model numbers for the second-generation AirPods are A2032 and A2031.[18]
                        
                        3rd generation
                        Apple announced the third generation AirPods on October 18, 2021. They feature an external redesign with shorter stems similar to AirPods Pro and use similar force touch controls. They include support for spatial audio and Dolby Atmos, IPX4 water resistance, skin detection and a case supporting MagSafe charging. Apple claims increased battery life, with AirPods lasting six hours and the charging case providing up to 30 hours.[25] Preorders of the third generation AirPods began on October 18, 2021. The third generation AirPods were released on October 26, 2021, and are priced at $179.[26]
                        
                        Technical specifications
                        All of the electronics and circuitry responsible for the audio drivers and Bluetooth transmission are stored entirely within the head of the AirPod. The battery is stored in the stem. The battery and circuit boards are connected via flex/ribbon cable.[citation needed]
                        
                        Compatibility
                        AirPods are compatible with any device that supports Bluetooth 4.0 or higher, including Android and Windows devices, although certain features such as automatic switching between devices are only available on Apple devices using iCloud.[11]
                        
                        The first-generation AirPods are fully compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch models with iOS 10 or later, Apple Watch models with watchOS 3 or later, and Mac models with macOS Sierra or later.[27]
                        
                        The second-generation AirPods are fully compatible with devices running iOS 12.2 or later, macOS Mojave 10.14.4 or later, and watchOS 5.2 or later.[28]
                        
                        Support
                        The lithium-ion batteries in AirPods can see significant degradation over time, with two-year-old sets lasting for less than half of the advertised five hours.[29][30] Apple has a program to service batteries and purchase replacement individual AirPods and charging cases. The replacement of one or both AirPods or the charging case has a lower price with AppleCare+ than without.[31] Apple offers battery servicing for free with AppleCare+ and for a fee without. However, this is just a replacement service, as AirPods batteries cannot be removed.[31]
                        
                        AirPods contain upgradeable firmware. Its original firmware was version 3.3.1. In February 2017, Apple released version 3.5.1,[32] 3.7.2 in May 2017,[33] and then 6.3.2 on March 26, 2019.[34] In July 2019, version 6.7.8 was released and 6.8.8 followed in September 2019.[2] In June 2020, firmware 2D15 was released (G2).[35] In September 2020, firmware 3A283 (G2 and Pro) was released[36] and in April 2021, firmware 3E751.[37][38] AirPods automatically sync through Apple's iCloud service, allowing users to switch audio sources to other supported devices connected by the same Apple ID.[39]
                        
                        Sales
                        Analysts estimate Apple sold between 14 million and 16 million AirPods in 2017.[40] In 2018, AirPods were Apple's most popular accessory product, with 35 million units sold.[41][42] 60 million units were sold in 2019.[43] Analysts estimate AirPods make up 60% of the global wireless headphone market and that Apple's entire Wearables products (Apple Watch, AirPods, and AirPods Pro) “is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500”.[44][45][43] An estimated 5-7% of Apple's revenue from AirPods comes from replacement earbuds and cases.[46]
                        
                        Cultural impact
                        On announcement day, AirPods were compared to Apple's previously existing EarPods (2012–present), with The Verge noting "They look... just like the old EarPods, with the wires cut off."[47] Initially mocked by many for their unfamiliar design (including CNN asking "Would people actually wear these?" in 2016),[48] their popularity grew rapidly over the years and they were voted the most popular "hearable" brand of 2019.[4]
                        
                        At an Apple earnings call in 2019, CEO Tim Cook called AirPods “nothing less than a cultural phenomenon.”[49] AirPods had become a viral sensation with memes circulating across the internet about its appearance and its relation to the removal of the headphone jack in iPhones.[50] However, as time wore on, AirPods became known as a status symbol.[51][52]
                        
                        Criticism
                        One criticism of AirPods is their high price; however, at launch they were actually priced less than most "true wireless" earbuds on the market (e.g. the Samsung Gear IconX and Bragi Dash) and remain competitively priced with similar products from other major brands.[53][54][55]
                        
                        Another prominent criticism was a problem that caused the charging case battery to deplete at a rapid rate despite the AirPods not being used. Users were reporting upwards of 30% idle discharge per day.[56] In response, Apple released a firmware update (version 3.5.1) for the AirPods, which addressed connectivity and battery drain problems.[57]
                        
                        Competition
                        Some consumers expressed the viewpoint that there were better options for wireless earphones based on quality and cost.[58][59] One of Apple's biggest competitors is Samsung, which markets wireless earbuds that are very similar to AirPods.[60] Another similar product line is from Apple's Beats Electronics, which sells products such as the Powerbeats Pro wireless earbuds.[61]
                        
                        There are many similar products to the AirPods, or more, wireless earbuds.</P></FONT>

                        <FONT SIZE="4">  <P>Apple Watch is a line of smartwatches produced by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking, health-oriented capabilities, and wireless telecommunication, and integrates with iOS and other Apple products and services.

                            The Apple Watch was released in April 2015[18][19] and quickly became the best-selling wearable device: 4.2 million were sold in the second quarter of fiscal 2015,[20][21] and more than 100 million people were estimated to use an Apple Watch as of December 2020.[22] Apple has introduced new generations of the Apple Watch with improved internal components each September[23][24][25][26]—each labeled by Apple a 'Series', with certain exceptions.[a]
                            
                            Each Series has been initially sold in multiple variants defined by the watch casing's material, color, and size (except for the budget watches Series 1 and SE, available only in aluminum[27][29]), and beginning with Series 3, by the option in the aluminum variants for LTE cellular connectivity, which comes standard with the other materials.[30] The band included with the watch can be selected from multiple options from Apple, and watch variants in aluminum co-branded with Nike and in stainless steel co-branded with Hermès are also offered, which include exclusive bands, colors, and digital watch faces carrying those companies' brandings.[30]
                            
                            The Apple Watch operates primarily in conjunction with the user's iPhone for functions such as configuring the watch and syncing data with iPhone apps, but can separately connect to a Wi-Fi network for some data-reliant purposes, including basic communications and audio streaming.[31][32] LTE-equipped models can connect to a mobile network, including for calling, texting, and installed mobile app data use, substantially reducing the need for an iPhone after initial setup. Although the paired iPhone need not be near the watch, to make a call with the watch, the paired iPhone must still be powered on and connected to a cellular network.[33][b] The oldest iPhone model that is compatible with any given Apple Watch depends on the version of system software installed on each device.[35] As of September 2021, new Apple Watches come with watchOS 8 preinstalled and require an iPhone running iOS 15, which is available for the iPhone 6S and later.[36The goal of the Apple Watch was to complement an iPhone and add new functions, and to free people from their phones.[37] Kevin Lynch was hired by Apple to make wearable technology for the wrist. He said: "People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that's a little more human, a little more in the moment when you're with somebody?"[37] Apple's development process was held under wraps until a Wired article revealed how some internal design decisions were made.[37]

                            Rumors as far back as 2011 speculated that Apple was developing a wearable variation of the iPod that would curve around the user's wrist, and feature Siri integration.[38] In February 2013, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple was beginning to develop an iOS-based smartwatch with a curved display.[39] That same month, Bloomberg reported that Apple's smartwatch project was "beyond the experimentation phase" with a team of about 100 designers.[40] In July 2013, Financial Times reported that Apple had begun hiring more employees to work on the smartwatch, and that it was targeting a retail release in late 2014.[41]
                            
                            Unveiling and release
                            In April 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook told The Wall Street Journal that the company was planning to launch new products that year, but revealed no specifics.[42] In June 2014, Reuters reported that production was expected to begin in July for an October release.[43]
                            
                            During a September 2014 press event where the iPhone 6 was also presented, the new watch product was introduced by Tim Cook. After a video focusing on the design process, Cook reappeared on stage wearing an Apple Watch.[44][45]
                            
                            In comparison to other Apple products and competing smartwatches, marketing of the Apple Watch promoted the device as a fashion accessory.[46][47] Apple later focused on its health and fitness-oriented features, in an effort to compete with dedicated activity trackers. The watchOS 3 added fitness tracking for wheelchair users, social sharing in the Activity app, and a Breathe app to facilitate mindfulness.[48]
                            
                            The device was not branded as "iWatch", which would have put it in line with its product lines such as iPod, iPhone, and iPad. In the United States, the "iWatch" trademark is owned by OMG Electronics – who was crowdfunding a device under the same name; it is owned in the European Union by Irish firm Probendi.[49][50] In July 2015, Probendi sued Apple Inc. for trademark infringement, arguing that through keyword advertising on the Google search engine, it caused advertising for the Apple Watch to appear on search results pages when users searched for the trademarked term "iWatch".[51]
                            
                            Release
                            Pre-orders for the Apple Watch began on April 10, 2015, with the official release on April 24.[52] Initially, it was not available at the Apple Store; customers could make appointments for demonstrations and fitting, but the device was not in-stock for walk-in purchases and had to be reserved and ordered online. CNET felt that this distribution model was designed to prevent Apple Store locations from having long line-ups due to the high demand.[53][54] Selected models were available in limited quantities at luxury boutiques and authorized resellers.[55] On June 4, 2015, Apple announced that it planned to stock Apple Watch models at its retail locations.[54] On August 24, 2015, Best Buy announced that it would begin stocking Apple Watch at its retail stores by the end of September.[56] Both T-Mobile US and Sprint also announced plans to offer Apple Watch through their retail stores.[57]
                            
                            In September 2015, Apple launched a new subset of Apple Watch, with a stainless steel body and leather band, in collaboration with Hermès.[58] The following year, Apple launched another subset of Apple Watches in collaboration with Nike dubbed "Apple Watch Nike+". Both subsets featured cosmetic customization, but otherwise functioned like standard Apple Watches.[59]
                            
                            Apple Watch went on sale in India in November 2015.[60] The device also launched in Chile, the Philippines, Indonesia, and South Africa.[61][62]

                            Series 4 (40 mm)
                            Each series of Apple Watch is offered in multiple variants, distinguished by the casing's material, color, and size,[63] with special bands and digital watch faces available for certain variants co-branded with Nike and Hermès, which are also sometimes accompanied by other unique extras, like stainless steel charging pucks, premium packaging, and exclusive color basic bands.[64][65][66][67]
                            
                            Originally at launch, the Apple Watch was marketed through 3 "collections", with the case made out of different materials:
                            
                            Apple Watch Sport (Aluminium case)
                            Apple Watch (Stainless steel case)
                            Apple Watch Edition (Originally released as an 18kt gold casing with newer materials in later models)
                            Since Series 2, Apple dropped the "Sport" moniker from the branding (apart from the sport bands). "Apple Watch Edition" branding still exists.[68]
                            
                            The Series 4, Series 5 and Series 6 were available in two sizes, 40 mm (1.6 in) and 44 mm (1.7 in), replacing the 38 mm (1.5 in) and 42 mm (1.7 in) sizes of the original Series 2, and Series 3 models.[69][70] The Series 7 is available in two sizes, 41 mm (1.6 in) and 45 mm (1.8 in). The design of the watch has not changed significantly since its release, so customizable bands and accessories are typically compatible with any Apple Watch of the same size, while 38 mm (1.5 in) straps also fit 40 mm (1.6 in) and 41 mm (1.6 in) watches, and 42 mm (1.7 in) straps fit 44 mm (1.7 in) and 45 mm (1.8 in) watches.[71] The casing of the watch includes a mechanism to enable the straps to be interchangeable.
                            
                            For input, the watch includes a "digital crown", which can be turned to scroll or zoom and pressed to return to the home screen, and a touchscreen that features Force Touch technology, which makes it pressure-sensitive and capable of distinguishing between a tap and a press. Force touch technology has been removed in Watch Series 6 and Watch SE.[15] The watch also has a side button which can be used to display recently used apps and access Apple Pay, which is used for contactless payment.[72] Apple rates the device's battery for 18 hours of mixed usage.[15][73] Apple Watch is charged by means of inductive charging.[18] If the watch's battery depletes to less than 10 percent, the user is alerted and offered to enable a "power reserve" mode, which allows the user to continue to read the time for an additional 72 hours, while other features are disabled. The watch then reverts to its original mode when recharged or after holding down the side button.[74]
                            
                            Apple did not explicitly market the first-generation Apple Watch as being waterproof, stating that it can withstand splashes of water (such as rain and hand washing), but does not recommend submersion (IPX7). Apple introduced a higher level of water resistance with the release of the Apple Watch Series 2, and the device was explicitly advertised as being suitable for swimming and surfing.[75] The Series 7 also includes an IP6X certification for dust resistanceApple Watch comes with an included band (strap) to attach it to the user's wrist, which can be easily changed to other types. Third party bands are compatible with Apple Watch, however Apple produces bands in a variety of materials and colours which are updated each season. The most recent update to the colours occurred in March 2020. Bands designed for the 38 mm and 42 mm cases are completely compatible with the 40 mm and 44 mm cases respectively as well as the 41 mm and 45 mm cases.

                            Starting with Apple Watch Series 5, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Studio which allows customers to mix and match bands, eliminating the need to purchase a specific combination and allows for a simplification of packaging (since Apple Watch Series 4).
                            
                            Hardware
                            First generation
                            
                            Apple S1
                            The 1st generation Apple Watch (colloquially referred to as Series 0) uses the single-core S1 system-on-chip. It does not have a built-in GPS chip, instead relying on a paired iPhone for location services. It uses a linear actuator called the "Taptic Engine" to provide haptic feedback when an alert or a notification is received, and is used for other purposes by certain apps.[15] The watch is equipped with a built-in heart rate sensor, which uses both infrared and visible-light LEDs and photodiodes.[76] All versions of the first-generation Apple Watch have 8 GB of storage; the operating system allows the user to store up to 2 GB of music and 75 MB of photos. When the Apple Watch is paired with an iPhone, all music on that iPhone is also available to be controlled and accessed from the Apple Watch.[77] Software support for the first Apple Watch ended with watchOS 4.3.2.
                            
                            Second generation (Series 1 and 2)
                            
                            Apple S2
                            The second generation Apple Watch has two models; the Apple Watch Series 1 and Apple Watch Series 2. The Series 1 has a variant of the dual-core Apple S2 processor with GPS removed, known as the Apple S1P. It has a lower starting price than first generation.[78] The Series 2 has the dual-core Apple S2 processor, water resistance to 50 meters, a display twice as bright, and a GPS receiver.[78][75] Software support for the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch ended with watchOS 6.3.
                            
                            Series 2 introduces water resistance at a rating of 50 meters. It can keep track of the number of laps and distance during Swimming workouts. During swimming, the touch function can be manually disabled with 'Underwater mode'. Once this is turned off, by rotating the Digital Crown continuously, it uses the speaker to expel residual water through a series of 10 vibrations. Series 2 also adds a built-in GPS system. Most recently used apps now are saved in the background, so apps and information load faster. The Series 2 was sold in casings of anodized Aluminium, Stainless Steel and Ceramic. The Series 1 was sold only in Aluminium. Series 1 & 2 have an advertised 18 hours of battery life. Series 2 adds a brighter 1000 nits display.[75]
                            
                            Third generation (Series 3)
                            
                            Apple S3
                            The Apple Watch Series 3 features a faster processor, the dual-core S3, Bluetooth 4.2 (compared to 4.0 on older models), a built-in altimeter for measuring flights of stairs climbed, increased RAM size, and is available in a variant with LTE cellular connectivity. Siri is able to speak on Apple Watch Series 3 due to the increased processing speed of the Watch.[79]
                            
                            Series 3 features LTE cellular connectivity for the first time in an Apple Watch, enabling users to make phone calls, iMessage and stream Apple Music and Podcasts directly on the watch, independent of an iPhone. The LTE model comes with an eSIM[80][81] and shares the same mobile number as the user's iPhone.[82]Fourth generation (Series 4)

                            Apple Watch Series 4
                            The Apple Watch Series 4[83] features larger displays with thinner bezels and rounded corners, a slightly rounder, thinner chassis with a redesigned ceramic back, a new S4 64-bit dual-core processor capable of up to double the S3's performance, upgraded 16 GB storage, new options for watch face customization, and a new electrical heart sensor which works by measuring the potential difference between the wrist and a finger from the opposing hand into the S4 Module over 30 seconds. The ECG system has received clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration, a first ever for a consumer device,[84] and is supported by the American Heart Association.[85] This device can also detect falls and will automatically contact emergency services unless the user cancels the outgoing call. The microphone was moved to the opposite side between the side button and the digital crown to improve call quality. Other changes include the digital crown incorporating haptic feedback with the Apple Haptic Engine and includes the new Apple-designed W3 wireless chip.
                            
                            The watch received mostly positive reviews from critics. TechRadar gave it a score of 4.5/5, calling it one of the top smartwatches, while criticizing the short battery life.[86] Digital Trends gave it a score of 5/5, calling it Apple's best product and praising the design, build quality, and software, among others, while criticizing the battery life.[87] CNET gave it a score of 8.2/10, calling it the "best overall smartwatch around", while criticizing the battery life and lack of watch face options.[88] T3 gave it a score of 5/5, calling it a "truly next-gen smartwatch" due to its thinner body and bigger screen compared to the Series 3, and health features.[89]
                            
                            Fifth generation (Series 5)
                            
                            Apple Watch Series 5
                            The Apple Watch Series 5 was announced on September 10, 2019.[90] Its principal improvements over its predecessor were the addition of a compass and an always-on display with a low-power display driver capable of refresh rates as low as once per second. Additional new features include International Emergency Calling enabling emergency calls in over 150 countries, a more energy-efficient S5 processor,[91] improved ambient light sensor, and storage doubled to 32 GB. It also brought back the "Edition" tier, with a ceramic model absent from the previous generation, and a new titanium model which comes in two colors: natural and Space Black.[92]
                            
                            The Series 5 and above (including the SE model introduced in 2020) also incorporate enhanced hardware- and software-based battery and performance management functionality.[93]
                            
                            Critics generally gave it a positive review. CNET gave it a score of 4/5, concluding, "The Apple Watch continues to be one of the best smartwatches, but it remains limited by being an iPhone accessory for now."[94] Digital Trends gave it a score of 4.5/5.[95] The Verge gave it a score of 9/10.[96]
                            
                            Sixth generation (Series 6 and SE)
                            
                            Apple S6
                            The Apple Watch Series 6 was announced on September 15, 2020, during an Apple Special Event and began shipping on September 18. Its principal improvement over its predecessor is the inclusion of a sensor to monitor blood oxygen saturation.[97]
                            
                            Additional features include a new S6 processor that is up to 20% faster than the S4 and S5,[98] a 2.5× brighter always-on display, and an always-on altimeter.[99] The S6 incorporates an updated, third generation optical heart rate sensor and also enhanced telecommunication technology, including support for ultra-wideband (UWB) via Apple's U1 chip, and the ability to connect to 5 GHz Wi-Fi networks. The Series 6 watch was updated with faster charging hardware such that it completes charging in ~1.5 hours.[100] Force Touch hardware was removed, consistent with the removal of all Force Touch functionality from watchOS 7.
                            
                            The Series 6 watch added Product Red and Navy Blue color options.
                            
                            At its September 2020 product introduction event, Apple also announced the Apple Watch SE, a lower-cost model.[98] The SE incorporates the same always-on altimeter as the Series 6,[101] but uses the previous-generation S5 processor and previous- (i.e. second) generation optical heart rate sensor; does not include ECG and blood oximiter sensors or an always-on display; and does not include UWB or 5 GHz Wi-Fi communication capabilities.
                            
                            Seventh generation (Series 7)
                            The Apple Watch Series 7 was announced on September 14, 2021, during an Apple Special Event.[102] Pre-orders opened on October 8, with earliest shipping dates starting on October 15.
                            
                            Enhancements relative to the prior-generation Series 6 watch include a more rounded design with a case 1mm larger than the Series 6; a display that is 70% brighter indoors and approximately 20% larger; improved durability via a crack-resistant front crystal;[103] IP6X certification for resistance to dust; 33% faster charging via improved internal electronics and an enhanced, USB-C based fast-charging cable; support for BeiDou (China's satellite navigation system); and the availability of an on-screen keyboard that can be tapped or swiped.[104] The Series 7 is also equipped with new hardware that enables ultra-rapid, short-range wireless data transfer at 60.5 GHz, though Apple has not fully explained this new functionality.[105]
                            
                            Following Apple's announcement of the Series 7, an independent software development company filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging inappropriate copying of the software keyboard functionality from an app that Apple had previously rejected from its App Store.[106][107]
                            
                            Software
                            Apple Watch runs watchOS, whose interface is based around a home screen with circular app icons, which can be changed to a list view in the devices settings. The OS can be navigated using the touchscreen or the crown on the side of the watch.[15] During its debut, the first generation Apple Watch needed to be paired with an iPhone 5 or later running iOS 8.2 or later; this version of iOS introduced the Apple Watch app, which is used to pair the watch with an iPhone, customize settings and loaded apps, and highlight compatible apps from the App Store.[15]
                            
                            The Apple Watch is capable of receiving notifications, messages, and phone calls via a paired iPhone.[15] "Glances" allowed users to swipe between pages containing widget-like displays of information; however, this feature was replaced by a new Control Center. watchOS also supports Handoff to send content from Apple Watch to an iOS or macOS device,[15] and act as a viewfinder for an iPhone camera,[72] Siri is also available for voice commands, and is capable of responding with voice prompts on the Series 3 watches.[15] Apple Watch also supports Apple Pay, and enables its use with older iPhone models that do not contain near-field communication (NFC) support.[15]
                            
                            Apple Watch's default apps are designed to interact with their iOS counterparts, such as Mail, Phone, Calendar, Messages, Maps, Music, Photos, Reminders, Remote (which can control iTunes and Apple TV), Stocks, and Wallet.[15] Using the Activity and Workout apps, a user can track their physical activity and send data back to the iPhone for use in its Health app and other HealthKit-enabled software.[15] With watchOS 3, Reminders, Home, Find My Friends, Heart Rate, and Breathe were added to the stock apps.
                            
                            With the release of watchOS 4 and the Series 3 Apple Watch, iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c support was dropped, requiring users to use an iPhone 5s or later with iOS 11 or later to use watchOS 4. Apple Watches still running watchOS 3 or below remain compatible with the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5c. Further, watchOS 5 dropped support for the original (Series 0) Apple Watch.[108] watchOS 6 requires iOS 13, and was the final version to support the Series 1 and Series 2 Apple Watch. watchOS 7 requires iOS 14. watchOS 8 requires iOS 15.

                            At WWDC 2015, Tim Cook announced watchOS 2.0; described by CNET as a "significant revamp", it included a new software development kit that allows more direct access to the device's hardware, new watch faces, the ability to reply to an e-mail, and other features.[109] WatchOS 2.0 was released in September 2015.[110] Following the software update, some users experienced issues with lag.[111]
                            
                            watchOS 3.0 was announced at WWDC 2016, with a priority on performance. Users are able to keep apps running in memory as well as receive background updates and refreshed information. Other updates include a new Dock invoked with the side button to replace the performance-laden Glances, an updated Control Center, and new reply options on Messages. Several new watch faces have also been added, including Minnie Mouse, along with the ability to switch watch faces from the lock screen simply by swiping. A new feature called SOS allows users to hold the dock button to make a call to the local emergency line and pull up the user's Medical ID. Another feature is Activity Sharing, which allows sharing of workouts with friends and even sending their heartbeats to one another. A new app called Breathe guides users through breathing exercises throughout the day, with visuals and haptic feedback. It was made available to the public in September 2016.
                            
                            watchOS 3.1 was released to the public in October 2016, and watchOS 3.2 was released in March 2017.[112] Both updates added minor improvements and bug fixes.
                            
                            WatchOS 4.0 was announced at WWDC 2017 and released to the public in September 2017. WatchOS 4 features a proactive Siri watch face, personalized activity coaching, and an entirely redesigned music app. It also introduces Apple GymKit, a technology platform to connect workouts with cardio equipment.
                            
                            WatchOS 4.3 was released in March 2018. It introduced support for Nightstand mode in portrait orientation. It brought back the ability for music playing on the iPhone to be controlled using the Music app on the Apple Watch and also enabled control of playback and volume on Apple's HomePod. Other new features included a new charging animation and a new app loading animation. Activity data was added to the Siri watch face, and the battery complication more accurately reports battery life.
                            
                            watchOS 5.0 was first shown to the public at the San Jose WWDC developer conference held by Apple. It introduced an instant watch-to-watch walkie-talkie mode, all-new Podcasts app, raise-wrist-to-speak Siri, customizable Control Center, and the ability to access the notification center and control center from apps. Other features included support for WebKit to view web pages, six new watch faces, and new workout running features.[113] It was released to the public in September 2018.[114] On the newest release of watchOS beta the sleep feature was shown on screen, this would eliminate the need to use third-party apps.
                            
                            watchOS 6.0 was released to the public in September 2019. It introduced more native iOS apps such as voice memos, calculator, and a native watchOS app store. watchOS 6.0 also introduced new features such as the noise app that allows you to measure the sound around you in decibels, menstrual tracking, and new watch faces. Other features include Siri being able to tell users what music they are listening to, activity trends, and a new UI framework for developers.
                            
                            watchOS 7.0 was announced on June 22, 2020, at the WWDC, and released on September 16, 2020; new functionalities include sleep tracking, additional watch faces, handwashing detection and new workouts such as dancing.[115]
                            
                            watchOS 8.0 was announced on June 7, 2021, at the WWDC, and released on September 20, 2021. It replaces the Breathe app with a new Mindfulness app, and adds a Focus mode as well as a Portrait Watch Face, updates to the Messages and Home apps, Contacts and Find My apps, and a redesigned Photos app.
                            
                            Third-party apps
                            In watchOS 1, third-party WatchKit applications run in the background on the iPhone as an application extension while a set of native user interface resources are installed on Apple Watch.[116] Thus, watchOS apps must be bundled within their respective iOS app, and are synced to the watch either manually, or automatically upon installation of the phone app.[15]
                            
                            With the release of watchOS 2, Apple made it mandatory for new watch apps to be developed with the watchOS 2 SDK from June 1, 2016, onwards; no third-party languages or SDKs can be used to develop apps.[117] This allowed for developers to create native apps that are run on the watch itself, thus improving the responsiveness of third-party apps.
                            
                            In watchOS 5 and earlier, all watchOS apps are dependent apps – the watchOS app relies on an iOS companion app in order to function properly.[118] However, in watchOS 6 or later, developers are able to create completely independent watchOS apps, and no longer require an app to be installed on the paired iPhone. This was assisted by the introduction of a separate App Store on the Apple Watch itself.[119].]</P></FONT>

                            <FONT SIZE="4">  <P>The HomePod is a smart speaker developed by Apple Inc. The HomePod was designed to work with the Apple Music subscription service.[7]

                                The HomePod was announced on June 5, 2017, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference.[8][9] Its launch was later delayed from December 2017 to early 2018.[9][10][11][12] Apple began taking orders on January 26, 2018, and formally released it on February 9 that year.[13] It incorporates beamforming and eight speakers and was sold in two colors: white and space gray.[14][15]
                                
                                The HomePod received mixed reviews: it was praised for its design and sound quality compared to other speakers of its price, and criticized for lack of third-party support and high price compared to other smart speakers. Additionally, the silicone base on the bottom of the device was found to occasionally damage wooden surfaces.
                                
                                As of August 2018, the HomePod had sold an estimated 1 to 3 million units. It was discontinued on March 12, 2021, in favor of the smaller and less expensive HomePod Mini.[16]The HomePod has a rounded, cylindrical shape, and has a small touchscreen on its top. It has seven tweeters in its base and a four-inch woofer (Apple does not specify Hz frequency range) towards the top, as well as six microphones used for voice control and acoustic optimization. The system-on-a-chip is the Apple A8, which Apple previously included in the Apple TV HD, iPod touch (6th generation), iPad mini 4 and iPhone 6/6 Plus.[17][18][19][20]

                                Siri can be used to control the speaker and other HomeKit devices, and can be used to conduct text messaging and voice calls from an iPhone. The HomePod mainly supports Apple's own platforms and technologies, including Apple Music, iTunes Store purchases and Match, iTunes podcasts, Beats 1 radio, and AirPlay (with limited third-party support for internet radio services iHeartRadio, Radio.com, and TuneIn coming in the fall of 2019), while an iOS 11 device is required for initial setup. HomePod can serve as a sound bar within a home entertainment system when selected through an Apple TV. The HomePod does not officially support audio-in from Bluetooth sources.[21][19] Andrew Faden has developed a solution he calls "BabelPod" to allow line in and Bluetooth input to the HomePod through the use of a Raspberry Pi.[22]
                                
                                AirPlay 2 and multi-room, multi-speaker support were announced in February 2018, and released in September 2018 in iOS 12 along with additional features such as multiple named timers, Find my iPhone, Siri shortcuts, the ability to make, receive and screen phone calls directly on the HomePod, and the ability to search for songs using the lyrics.[23] HomePod initially lacked support for allowing multiple users to use the device,[24] but multi user support was eventually added with the release of iOS 13.2.[25]
                                
                                The 13.4 software update, released in March 2020, updated the OS from an iOS code base to a tvOS based system.[26]
                                
                                Greenhouse gas emissions for production, expected use and recycling for the HomePod are estimated at 146 kg CO2e.[27]
                                
                                Reception
                                The HomePod received mixed reviews. The review from The Verge praised the HomePod's automatic acoustic calibration system, and felt that it sounded "noticeably richer and fuller" than competitors such as the Sonos One (described as sounding "a little empty") and Google Home Max (described as being a "bass-heavy mess").[15] The review from Ars Technica stated that the sound quality of the HomePod was "pretty good, rich and full for its size, better than the Sonos One but probably not $150 better, [and] a galaxy ahead of the Echo."[24]
                                
                                Its lack of support for third-party services and platforms was criticized,[19][24][15] with Ars Technica arguing that it gave the device "intense inflexibility".[24] Siri on the HomePod was also criticized for its limited functionality in comparison to assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant; The Verge cited the inability to actually place phone calls from the speaker (they must be made on an iPhone and transferred to the HomePod), set multiple timers at once, or distinguish between multiple voices, and only supporting basic commands when using AirPlay, among other limitations.[15][19] Multiple reminders can be used in lieu of multiple timers, albeit with less precision than a timer.[28][29][30][31][32][33] All these issues have been fixed in iOS 12, released on September 17, 2018.[23]
                                
                                The Verge gave HomePod a 7.5 out of 10, writing that it "does more to make music sound better than any other speaker of this kind has ever done before", but that consumers should consider other options "unless you live entirely inside Apple's walled garden and prioritize sound quality over everything else."[15] Wired shared similar criticisms over its lack of Siri functionality and support for third-party services, concluding that the HomePod would be of little interest to those who are not heavily invested in Apple's software and hardware ecosystem.[19]
                                
                                It was reported by some owners that the HomePod's silicone base stained oiled wooden surfaces with a white "ring" mark.[34] Although Apple states that "it is not unusual for any speaker with a vibration-dampening silicone base to leave mild marks when placed on some wooden surfaces", and that the marks would eventually "improve" on its own, Stuart Miles (founder of the British technology blog Pocket-lint) reported that in his experience, the stain occurred after only about 20 minutes of use on a wooden surface, and that he had to sand and re-oil the surface to remove it.[35] John Gruber criticized Apple for this abnormality, remarking that he had never seen an Apple product damage surfaces in such a manner before, and that it "seems like an issue that should have been caught during the period where HomePod was being widely tested at home by many Apple employees."[36]
                                
                                Marketing and sales
                                Apple released a four-minute short film "Welcome Home", directed by Spike Jonze and starring FKA Twigs, to promote the HomePod, along with commercial-length versions.[37]
                                
                                Strategy Analytics estimated that around 600,000 HomePods were sold in first quarter of 2018, making Apple the fourth best selling smart speaker brand after Amazon, Google and Alibaba, giving Apple a 6% market share in the industry.[38] The HomePod also has 6% market share in the United States according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners and sold an estimated 700,000 units worldwide in the second quarter of 2018.[39][40] Also in the second quarter of 2018, Strategy Analytics estimated that the HomePod outsold all smart speakers that cost more than $200, giving Apple a 70% market share in premium brand smart speakers.[41] As of mid 2018, the HomePod had sold an estimated 3 million units.[42] Sales increased 45% in Q4 2018, with Apple selling 1.6 million units that quarter.[43] In April 2019, Apple reduced the price to USD $299.[44] In March 2021, the price got reduced to £279.[45] As of May 2021, Apple was still reportedly selling units manufactured for the HomePod's launch stock.[46]
                                
                                Discontinuation
                                On March 12, 2021, Apple discontinued the HomePod in favor of the HomePod Mini. In a statement, Apple said "HomePod Mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99. We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini. We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers. Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care."[47]</P></FONT>

                                <FONT SIZE="4"></FONT> <P>AirTag is a tracking device developed by Apple. AirTag is designed to act as a key finder, which helps people find personal objects (e.g. keys, bags, apparel, small electronic devices, vehicles). To locate lost items, AirTags use Apple's crowdsourced Find My network, estimated in early 2021 to consist of approximately one billion devices worldwide that detect and anonymously report emitted Bluetooth signals.[2] AirTags are compatible with any iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch device capable of running iOS/iPadOS 14.5 or later. Using the built-in U1 chip on iPhone 11 or later (excluding iPhone SE 2nd generation), users can more precisely locate items using UWB (ultra-wideband) technology. AirTag was announced on April 20, 2021, made available for pre-order on April 23, and released on April 30The product was first rumored to be under development in April 2019. In February 2020, it was reported that Asahi Kasei was prepared to supply Apple with tens of millions of ultra-wideband (UWB) parts for the rumored AirTag in the second and third quarters of 2020, though the shipment was ultimately delayed.[4] On April 2, 2020, a YouTube video on Apple Support[5] page also confirmed AirTag.[6] In Apple's iOS 14.0 release, code was discovered that described the reusable and removable battery that would be used in the AirTag.[7][8] In March 2021, MacWorld stated that iOS 14.5 beta's Find My user interface included "Items" and "Accessories" features meant for AirTag support for a user's "backpack, luggage, headphones" and other objects.[9] AppleInsider noted that the beta included safety warnings for "unauthorized AirTags" persistently in the user's vicinity.[10]

                                    AirTag set up on iOS
                                    AirTags can be interacted with using the Find My app. Users may trigger the AirTag to play a sound from the app. iPhones equipped with the U1 chip can use "Precision Tracking" to provide direction to and precise distance from an AirTag. Precision Tracking utilizes ultra-wideband.[3]
                                    
                                    AirTags are not satellite navigation devices. AirTags are located on a map within the Find My app by utilizing Bluetooth signals from other anonymous iOS and iPadOS devices out in the world. To help prevent unwanted tracking, an iOS/iPadOS device will alert their owner if someone else's AirTag seems to be with them, instead of with the AirTag's owner, for too long.[11] If an AirTag is out of range of any Apple device for more than 8 to 24 hours,[12] it will begin to beep to alert a person that an AirTag may have been placed in their possessions.[13]
                                    
                                    Users can mark an AirTag as lost and provide a phone number and a message. Any iPhone user can see this phone number and message with the "identify lost item" feature within the Find My app which utilizes near-field communication (NFC) technology. Additionally, Android and Windows 10 Mobile phones with NFC can identify an AirTag with a tap, which will redirect to a website containing the message and phone number.[3][14]
                                    
                                    AirTag requires an Apple ID and iOS or iPadOS 14.5 or later.[15] It uses the CR2032 button cell replaceable with one year of battery life (though batteries with child-resistant bitterants cannot be used due to the design of the AirTag battery terminal).[16] The maximum range of Bluetooth tracking is estimated to be around 100 meters. The water-resistance of an AirTag is rated IP67 water and dust; an AirTag can withstand 30 minutes of water immersion in standard laboratory conditions. Each Apple ID is limited to 16 AirTags.[7]

                                    Stalking
                                    Despite Apple's including technologies to help prevent unwanted tracking or stalking, The Washington Post found that it was "frighteningly easy" to bypass the systems put in place. Concerns included the built-in audible alarm taking three days to sound, and the fact that most Americans had Android devices that would not receive alerts about nearby AirTags that iPhone devices receive.[17] It is also possible to defeat the audible alarm by forcibly opening an AirTag and removing the speaker magnet; the AirTag does not detect this modification.[18] In 2022 BBC News spoke to six women who have been stalked using AirTags.[19]
                                    
                                    In late 2021 Apple released an app called Tracker Detect[20] to help users of Android 9 or later to discover unknown AirTags near them in a "lost" state and potentially being used for malicious tracking purposes;[21] the app must be downloaded by the user and only detects AirTags when it is running.[19]
                                    
                                    Car theft
                                    The National Post reported that AirTags were placed on vehicles at shopping malls and parking lots without the drivers' knowledge, in order to track them to their homes, where the vehicles would be stolen.[22] In response, Apple announced just before WWDC 2021 that it had begun rolling out updates that would allow anyone with an NFC-capable phone to tap an unwanted AirTag for instructions on how to disable it, and that they had decreased the delay time for the audible alert that sounds after the AirTag is separated from its owner from three days to a random time between 8 and 24 hours.[23]

                                    Trojan Horse
                                    Users who set their AirTags to lost mode are prompted to provide a contact phone number for finders to call. In September 2021, security researcher Brian Krebs noted that the phone number field will actually accept any type of input, including arbitrary computer code, opening up the potential use of AirTags as Trojan Horse devices.[24]
                                    
                                    Tile
                                    Similar product manufacturer Tile criticized Apple for using similar technologies and designs to Tile's trackers.[11] Spokespeople for Tile made a testimony to the United States Congress saying that Apple was supporting "anti-competitive practices",[25] claiming that Apple had done this in the past and that they think it is "entirely appropriate for Congress to take a closer look at Apple’s business practices".[26]
                                    
                                    Loop
                                    AirTags do not have holes or other mechanical features that would allow them to be positively attached or affixed to the item being tracked; solutions include adhesives (glue, tape) and purpose-built accessories. The polyurethane AirTag Loop is the least expensive solution sold by Apple;[27] it costs the same as a single AirTag and has been criticized as an "accessory tax".[28]</P>
