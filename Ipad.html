         <P>The iPad is a brand of iOS and iPadOS-based tablet computers developed by Apple Inc. It is the successor of the Newton MessagePad and an unreleased prototype of the PowerBook Duo-based tablet computer. Apple concepted the iPad before the related iPhone, although the latter was developed and released first. Speculations of the original iPad began in 2002, and dealt with its development, operating system, and release, prior to its introduction on January 20, 2010. It consists of four lineups, the original iPad lineup and three flagships, iPad Mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro.

         It initially used the iPhone's iOS operating system but was later replaced with an optimized derivation of iOS, iPadOS.Apple's first tablet computer and the iPad's predecessor was the Newton MessagePad, which was introduced in 1993. Apple also designed an alternative prototype of the PowerBook Duo-based tablet computer but decided not to sell it to avoid hurting MessagePad sales.[3][4] The Newton MessagePad was created under the leadership of John Sculley, who succeeded Apple co-founder Steve Jobs after he was forced out of Apple in 1985. The MessagePad was a technological failure, and its handwriting recognition often resulted in an indecipherable jumble of words. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he discontinued the MessagePad.[5]

         The development of an iPad tablet computer was first speculated in 2002 when Apple's associated manufacturing company Quanta leaked orders from Apple on wireless displays. Less than two weeks later after US Design Patent No. D504,889 leaked a concept design of the iPad in May 2005, the blogger Rob Bushway speculated that it would use a stripped-down version of OS X. Speculation then turned to Intel, who was visited by Apple to sought a chip to use on one of their potential products, speculatively the iPad. In September 2009, the Taiwan Economic News said that the iPad would be announced sometimes in February 2010 and cited "industry sources," but it was in fact, announced in January 2010.[6]
         
         The iPad's conception predated that of the iPhone, although the iPhone was chronologically developed and released before the iPad.[7][8] In 1991, Apple chief design officer Jonathan Ive devised an industrial design of a stylus-based tablet, the Macintosh Folio, which laid the foundation for a larger tablet prototype project codenamed K48 (the iPad) that Apple began in 2004. After seeking to develop the tablet first, Ive come to an agreement with Jobs that the iPhone was more important and reversed the order.[9][10][11]
         
         iPad
         The first generation of iPad was announced on January 20, 2010,[12] with pre-order began on March 12.[13] The Wi-Fi version was released in the United States on April 3, while the Wi-Fi- 3G version was released on April 30 [14] Apple released the first generation of iPad internationally on May 28, July 23, and September 17. It used an single-GHz Apple A4 chip, with 256 MB of RAM, and a PowerVR SGX535 GPU. Its four switches included a home button (which directs the user to its homepage), and the wake/sleep and volume/down switches. Its multitouch-based display had a resolution of 1,024 by 768 pixels.[15]
         
         The second generation of iPad was announced on March 2, 2011 and released on March 11. It is 33% thinner and 15% lighter than its predecessor, and it used a dual-core Apple A5 chip, which comprised a 2x faster CPU and a 9x faster GPU. It added several front-and-back cameras that support Apple's FaceTime video-telephony service. Apple reduced the size of the iPad by eliminating the stamped sheet metal frame from its display and integrated a thinner glass technology for the screen overlay. In addition to a slight contract of space between the display and battery.[16][17][18]
         
         The third generation of iPad was announced on March 7, 2012 and released on March 16, 2012.[19] It featured a dual-core Apple A5X chip embedded with quad-core graphics. Its Retina Display had a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536 pixels, 50% more pixel densities than standard displays. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic "native" orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.[20][21The fourth generation of iPad was announced on October 23, 2012 and released on November 2. It had an A6X chip, an added 1020P FaceTime HD camera, improved LTE and WiFi connectivity, and it added supports for Touch ID, a fingerprint recognition biometric authentication. It featured a 5-megapixel, rear-facing camera capable of recording 1080p-quality videos; and a 720p HD front-facing FaceTime HD camera. Its display had a resolution of 2,048 by 1,536 pixels.[22][23][24]

         The fifth generation of iPad was announced on March 21, 2017 and released on March 24. It used an Apple A9 chip with an accompanying M9 motion coprocessor, and its front-and-back cameras can capture low-light and HD-quality shots. Despite its use of the Apple A9 and M9 processors debuted with the iPhone 6s in 2015, it lacked support of the default always-on "Hey Siri" voice, a feature advertised as being made possible by low-power processing in the then-new chips.[25][26]
         
         The sixth generation of iPad was announced on released on March 27. It used a dual-core Apple A10 Fusion chip ,and it featured a front-rear camera, a 1080p and 30fps rear mounted 8-megapixel iSight camera, and a 720p-quality Facetime HD camera. It also had faster FaceTime HD, LTE connectivity, Touch ID, and multitask functionalities.[27]
         
         The seventh generation of iPad was announced on September 10, 2019 and released on September 25. It uses a 64-bit Apple A10 Fusion chip, which is 2x faster than the then-bestselling Windows PC, and its Retina Display had a resolution of 3.5 million pixels It added support for the accessory Smart Keyboard.[28]
         
         The eighth generation of iPad was announced on September 15, 2020 and released on September 18. It used an Apple A12 Bionic chip, which comprised a 40% faster 6-core CPU and a 2x faster 4-core CPU than its predecessor. The Apple A12 also included an embedded Neural Engine, and is capable of processing 5 trillion operations per second. Its Retina Display had a resolution of 1668 by 2388 pixels.[29][30]
         
         The ninth generation of iPad was announced and released on September 14, 2021. It used an Apple A13 Bionic chip, which comprised a 20% faster CPU, GPU, and an embedded, artificial intelligence-immersed Neural Engine.[31] Its 12-megapixel front camera add support for Apple's "Center Stage Mode" technology, which pinpoints the positions of the users and automatically tracks the camera view accordingly to perspectivally centralize them. Its Retina Display featured True Tone technology, which automatically adjust the screen color temperature accordingly to the ambident lightning rates.[32][33]
         
         iPad Mini
         The first generation of the flagship, smaller iPad Mini was announced on October 23, 2012 and released on November 2.

In addition to a FaceTime HD camera, a 5-megapixel iSight camera, an ultrafast wireless LTE range, and a 802.11a/b/g/n standard Wifi connectivity. It is aimed at the at the emerging sector of mini tablets such as Kindle Fire and Nexus 7.[23]
         
         The second generation of iPad Mini was announced on October 22, 2013 and released on November 12, 2013, resembling the hardware of the first generation of iPad Air. (below) [34]
         
         The third generation of iPad Mini was announced on October 16, 2014 and released on October 22. It used an Apple A7 chip with an embedded M7 motion coprocessor, and its 7.9-inch Retina screen display had a resolution of 2048 by 1536-pixel. It included a 1080p HD camera, a FaceTime HD camera, and a 5-megapixel iSight camera.[35]
         
         The fourth generation of iPad Mini was announced and released on September 9, 2015. It used a dual-core Apple A8 chip with the embedded Apple M8 motion coprocessor. Its headphone jack was re-positioned with the removal of a mute switch.[36]
         
         The fifth generation of iPad Mini was announced and released on March 18, 2019. It used an Apple A12 Bionic chip, with a 3x faster CPU and a 9x faster GPU than its predecessor.

Its front 7-megapixel Facetime Camera is of 1080p and 60 fps, while its 12-megapixel webcam featured 8 aperture, 4k, 60fps, and video stabilization. Apple re-integrated Touch ID and replaced Face ID due to the Face ID's inaccurate recognition to mask-wearing users in the Covid-19 pandemic.[41][42]
         
         iPad Pro
         The first generation of iPad Pro, a high-end and professional flagship, was announced on September 9, 2015 and released on November 11, (12.9-inch version) and March 31 (9.7-inch).It used an Apple A9X chip, with a 2x higher memory bandwidth and a 1.8x faster CPU than its predecessor.

The 12.0-inch version had a mini LED-based Liquid Retina XDR display, compared to the 11-inch model's lesser IPS LCD-based Liquid Retina display.[48][49]
         
         Operating system support 
         Cellular connectivity
         iPad models come in two basic variants: Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi with cellular support. The cellular variants however do not support circuit-switched voice calls and texts, only data connectivity. The side of the Wi-Fi + 3G iPad had a micro-SIM slot (not mini-SIM). The 3G iPad can be used with any compatible GSM carrier, unlike the iPhone, which is usually sold 'locked' to specific carriers.[50] On the first generations of the iPad in the U.S., data network access via T-Mobile's network was limited to slower EDGE cellular speeds because T-Mobile's 3G Network at the time used different frequencies.[51][52]
         
         The second generation iPad introduced a third tier of models with CDMA support for Verizon Wireless in the United States, available separately from the AT&T capable version.[53]
         
         The iPad up to the 4th generation uses a Micro-SIM, while the first-generation iPad Mini uses a nano-SIM as introduced with the iPhone 5. The iPad mini is available with two different frequency bands worldwide. Both devices support the same quad-band GSM and quad-band UMTS frequencies, but one variant also supports LTE bands 4 and 17 (principally intended for use on the U.S. AT&T network), while the other adds support for LTE bands 1, 3, 5, 13, 25 and CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and Rev. B.[citation needed]
         
         The 5th generation iPad and 2nd generation iPad mini introduced support for many additional LTE bands worldwide. The iPad Air and Mini with Retina display cellular models come in two variants each, all of which support nano-SIMs, quad-band GSM, pentaband UMTS, and dual-band CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and B. Additionally, one variant of each iPad also supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25 and 26 while the other variant supports LTE bands 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 18, 19, 20 and TD-LTE bands 38, 39 and 40. Apple's ability to handle many different bands in one device allowed it to offer, for the first time, a single iPad variant that supports all the cellular bands and technologies deployed by all the major North American wireless providers at the time of the device's introduction. Moreover, with T-Mobile USA selling the iPad Air and Mini with Retina display, these models became the first iPads that were made available for purchase directly from all four nationwide U.S. wireless carriers (and, as previously indicated, with all U.S. carriers now selling the same hardware variant of the device).[citation needed]
         
         Accessories
         Main article: iPad accessories
         Apple offers several iPad accessories,[54] most of which are adapters for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack.[55] A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad,[56] but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can be charged by a standalone power adapter ("wall charger") also used for iPods and iPhones, and a 10 W charger is included with the iPad.[citation needed]
         
         Apple sells a camera connection kit that consists of two separate adapters for the dock connector, one to USB Type A, the other an SD card reader. Adapter can be used to transfer photos and videos and to plug USB audio card or MIDI keyboard.[57] A third party sells an adapter that includes USB, SD, and MicroSD on a single unit.[58] An adapter to VGA connectors allows the iPad to work with external monitors and projectors. Another adapter mirrors the screen onto HDMI compatible devices in 1080p and works with all apps and rotations. Unlike other adapters, it allows the iPad to charge through another dock connector.[59] While the HDMI adapter was released with and advertised for the second generation iPad, it also works with the first-generation iPad, the iPhone 4, and the fourth generation iPod Touch.[60]
         
         Smart Covers are screen protectors that magnetically attach and align to the face of the iPad 2, 3, or 4. The cover has three folds which allow it to convert into a stand, which is also held together by magnets.[61] While original iPad owners could purchase a black case that included a similarly folding cover, the Smart Cover is meant to be more minimal, easily detachable, and protects only the screen. Smart Covers have a microfiber bottom that cleans the front of the iPad (which wakes up when the cover is removed). There are five different colors of both polyurethane and leather, with leather being more expensive. Smart Covers are not compatible with the original iPad.[62] In June 2012, Apple started selling the Smart Case – a case with the combined function of a smart cover and a back protection case which is compatible with the iPad 2, and iPad 3rd & 4th generation devices.[63]
         
         Software
         Main articles: iPadOS, iOS, and iOS version history
         Like the iPhone, with which it shares a development environment[64] the iPad only runs its own software, software downloaded from Apple's App Store, and software written by developers who have paid for a developer's license on registered devices.[65][failed verification] The iPad runs almost all third-party iPhone applications, displaying them at iPhone size or enlarging them to fill the iPad's screen.[66] Developers may also create or modify apps to take advantage of the iPad's features,[67] and there are one million apps optimized for the iPad, as of March 2016.[68] Application developers use iOS SDK for developing applications for iPad.[69] The iPad originally shipped with a customized iPad-only version of iPhone OS, dubbed v3.2. On September 1, it was announced the iPad would get iOS 4.2 by November 2010;[70] to fulfill this Apple released iOS 4.2.1 to the public on November 22.[71]
         
         Interface
         The interface is centred on the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing an open application in the process.[72][failed verification]
         
         Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons, and the dock holds up to six icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed.[citation needed]
         
         Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using multi-touch. The iPad's interaction techniques enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as "pinching".[citation needed]
         
         Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.[citation needed]
         
         Other user-centered interactive effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a "back" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.[citation needed]
         
         Multimedia
         The layout of the music library is similar to an iPod or current[when?] Symbian S60 phones. The iPad can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.[citation needed]
         
         Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow, likewise this feature may be disabled if purposely wishing to view a screen from another angle. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks.[citation needed]
         
         The iPad supports gapless playback.[73] Like the fifth-generation iPods introduced in 2005, the iPad can play digital video, allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in widescreen. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and fullscreen video playback.[citation needed]
         
         The iPad allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.[citation needed]
         
         Internet connectivity
         The iPad can use Wi-Fi network trilateration from Skyhook Wireless to provide location information to applications such as Google Maps. The 3G model supports A-GPS to allow its position to be calculated with GPS or relative to nearby cellphone towers; it also has a black strip on the back to aid 3G reception.[74] The iPad has a headphone jack and a proprietary Apple dock connector, but no Ethernet or USB port.[55] However, the Apple Camera Connection Kit accessory provides two dock connector adapters for importing photos and videos via USB and SD memory cards.[citation needed]
         
         Applications
         The iPad comes with several applications, including Safari, Mail, Photos, Video, iPod, iTunes, App Store, Apple Books, Maps, Notes, Calendar, and Contacts.[75] Several are improved versions of applications developed for the iPhone or Mac. The apps currently missing are the weather, calculator, and health apps.[76]
         
         The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC.[77] Apple ported its iWork suite from the Mac to the iPad, and sells pared down versions of Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps in the App Store.[78] Although the iPad is not designed to replace a mobile phone, a user can use a wired headset or the built-in speaker and microphone and place telephone calls over Wi-Fi or 3G using a VoIP application.[79] As of June 2012, there were about 225,000 iPad specific apps on the App Store.[80][needs update]
         
         In December 2010, Reuters reported that iPhone and iPad users have lodged a lawsuit against Apple alleging that some applications were passing their information to third party advertisers without consent.[81]]</P>
